3151 mathematics disorder

the essential feature of mathematics disorder is mathematical ability as measured by individually administered standardized tests of mathematical calculation or reasoning that falls substantially below that expected for the individual's chronological age measured intelligence and age appropriate education criterion a the disturbance in mathematics significantly interferes with academic achievement or with activities of daily living that require mathematical skills criterion b if a sensory deficit is present the difficulties in mathematical ability are in excess of those usually associated with it criterion c if a neurological or other general medical condition or sensory deficit is present it should be coded on axis iii a number of different skills may be impaired in mathematics disorder including linguistic skills understanding or naming mathematical terms operations or concepts and decoding written problems into mathematical symbols perceptual skills recognizing or reading numerical symbols or arithmetic signs and clustering objects into groups attention skills copying numbers or figures correctly remembering to add in carried numbers and observing operational signs and mathematical skills following sequences of mathematical steps counting objects and learning multiplication tables
