Mental RetardationDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning  Criterion A  that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas  communication  self-care  home living  social/interpersonal skills  use of community resources  self-direction  functional academic skills  work  leisure  health  and safety  Criterion B   The onset must occur before age 18 years  Criterion C   Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the central nervous system General intellectual functioning is defined by the intelligence quotient  IQ or IQ-equivalent  obtained by assessment with one or more of the standardized  individually administered intelligence tests  e g   Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Childrenâ€” Revised  Stanford-Binet  Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children   Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is defined as an IQ of about 70 or below  approximately 2 standard deviations below the mean   It should be noted that there is a measurement error of approximately 5 points in assessing IQ  although this may vary from instrument to instrument  e g   a Wechsler IQ of 70 is considered to represent a range of 65-75   Thus  it is possible to diagnose Mental Retardation in individuals with IQs between 70 and 75 who exhibit significant deficits in adaptive behavior  Conversely  Mental Retardation would not be diagnosed in an individual with an IQ lower than 70 if there are no significant deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning  The choice of testing instruments and interpretation of results should take into account factors that may limit test performance  e g   the individual's sociocultural background  native language  and associated communicative  motor  and sensory handicaps   When there is significant scatter in the subtest scores  the profile of strengths and weaknesses  rather than the mathematically derived full-scale IQ  will more accurately reflect the person's learning abilities  When there is a marked discrepancy across verbal and performance scores  averaging to obtain a full-scale IQ score can be misleading Impairments in adaptive functioning  rather than a low IQ  are usually the presenting symptoms in individuals with Mental Retardation  Adaptive functioning refers to how effectively individuals cope with common life demands and how well they meet the standards of personal independence expected of someone in their particular age group  sociocultural background  and community setting  Adaptive functioning may be influenced by various factors  including education  motivation  personality characteristics  social and vocational opportunities  and the mental disorders and general medical conditions that may coexist with Mental Retardation  Problems in adaptation are more likely to improve with remedial efforts than is the cognitive IQ  which tends to remain a more stable attribute It is useful to gather evidence for deficits in adaptive functioning from one or more reliable independent sources  e g   teacher evaluation and educational  developmental  and medical history   Several scales have also been designed to measure adaptive functioning or behavior  e g   the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales and the American Association on Mental Retardation Adaptive Behavior Scale   These scales generally provide a clinical cutoff score that is a composite of performance in a number of adaptive skill domains  It should be noted that scores for certain individual domains are not included in some of these instruments and that individual domain scores may vary considerably in reliability  As in the assessment of intellectual functioning  consideration should be given to the suitability of the instrument to the person's sociocultural background  education  associated handicaps  motivation  and cooperation  For instance  the presence of significant handicaps invalidates many adaptive scale norms  In addition  behaviors that would normally be considered maladaptive  e g   dependency  passivity  may be evidence of good adaptation in the context of a particular individual's life  e g   in some institutional settings  315 00 Reading DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Reading Disorder is reading achievement  i e   reading accuracy  speed  or comprehension as measured by individually administered standardized tests  that falls substantially below that expected given the individual's chronological age  measured intelligence  and age-appropriate education  Criterion A   The disturbance in reading significantly interferes with academic achievement or with activities of daily living that require reading skills  Criterion B   If a sensory deficit is present  the reading difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with it  Criterion C   If a neurological or other general medical condition or sensory deficit is present  it should be coded on Axis III  In individuals with Reading Disorder  which has also been called "dyslexia"   oral reading is characterized by distortions  substitutions  or omissions  both oral and silent reading are characterized by slowness and errors in comprehension 315 1 Mathematics DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Mathematics Disorder is mathematical ability  as measured by individually administered standardized tests of mathematical calculation or reasoning  that falls substantially below that expected for the individual's chronological age  measured intelligence  and age-appropriate education  Criterion A   The disturbance in mathematics significantly interferes with academic achievement or with activities of daily living that require mathematical skills  Criterion B   If a sensory deficit is present  the difficulties in mathematical ability are in excess of those usually associated with it  Criterion C   If a neurological or other general medical condition or sensory deficit is present  it should be coded on Axis III  A number of different skills may be impaired in Mathematics Disorder  including "linguistic" skills  e g   understanding or naming mathematical terms  operations  or concepts  and decoding written problems into mathematical symbols   "perceptual" skills  e g   recognizing or reading numerical symbols or arithmetic signs  and clustering objects into groups   "attention" skills  e g   copying numbers or figures correctly  remembering to add in "carried" numbers  and observing operational signs   and "mathematical"skills  e g   following sequences of mathematical steps  counting objects  and learning multiplication tables  315 2 Disorder of Written ExpressionDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Disorder of Written Expression is writing skills  as measured by an individually administered standardized test or functional assessment of writing skills  that fall substantially below those expected given the individual's chronological age  measured intelligence  and age-appropriate education  Criterion A   The disturbance in written expression significantly interferes with academic achievement or with activities of daily living that require writing skills  Criterion B   If a sensory deficit is present  the difficulties in writing skills are in excess of those usually associated with it  Criterion C   If a neurological or other general medical condition or sensory deficit is present  it should be coded on Axis III  There is generally a combination of difficulties in the individual's ability to compose written texts evidenced by grammatical or punctuation errors within sentences  poor paragraph organization  multiple spelling errors  and excessively poor handwriting  This diagnosis is generally not given if there are only spelling errors or poor handwriting in the absence of other impairment in written expression  Compared with other Learning Disorders  relatively less is known about Disorders of Written Expression and their remediation  particularly when they occur in the absence of Reading Disorder  Except for spelling  standardized tests in this area are less well developed than tests of reading or mathematical ability  and the evaluation of impairment in written skills may require a comparison between extensive samples of the individual's written schoolwork and expected performance for age and IQ  This is especially the case for young children in the early elementary grades  Tasks in which the child is asked to copy  write to dictation  and write spontaneously may all be necessary to establish the presence and extent of this disorder 315 9 Learning Disorder Not Otherwise SpecifiedThis category is for disorders in learning that do not meet criteria for any specific Learning Disorder  This category might include problems in all three areas  reading  mathematics  written expression  that together significantly interfere with academic achievement even though performance on tests measuring each individual skill is not substantially below that expected given the person's chronological age  measured intelligence  and age- appropriate education 
315 4 Developmental Coordination DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Developmental Coordination Disorder is a marked impairment in the development of motor coordination  Criterion A   The diagnosis is made only if this impairment significantly interferes with academic achievement or activities of daily living  Criterion B   The diagnosis is made if the coordination difficulties are not due to a general medical condition  e g   cerebral palsy  hemiplegia  or muscular dystrophy  and the criteria are not met for Pervasive Developmental Disorder  Criterion C   If Mental Retardation is present  the motor difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with it  Criterion D   The manifestations of this disorder vary with age and development  For example  younger children may display clumsiness and delays in achieving developmental motor milestones  e g   walking  crawling  sitting  tying shoelaces 
54 Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy  Childhood  or Adolescencebuttoning shirts  zipping pants   Older children may display difficulties with the motor aspects of assembling puzzles  building models  playing ball  and printing or handwriting 315 31 Expressive Language DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Expressive Language Disorder is an impairment in expressive language development as demonstrated by scores on standardized individually administered measures of expressive language development substantially below those obtained from standardized measures of both nonverbal intellectual capacity and receptive language development  Criterion A   The difficulties may occur in communication involving both verbal language and sign language  The language difficulties interfere with academic or occupational achievement or with social communication  Criterion B   The symptoms do not meet criteria for Mixed Receptive-Expressive Language Disorder or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder  Criterion C   If Mental Retardation  a speech- motor or sensory deficit  or environmental deprivation is present  the language difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with these problems  Criterion D   If a speech-motor or sensory deficit or neurological condition is present  it should be coded on AxisIII The linguistic features of the disorder vary depending on its severity and the age of the child  These features include a limited amount of speech  limited range of vocabulary  difficulty acquiring new words word-finding or vocabulary errors shortened sentences  simplified grammatical structures  limited varieties of grammatical structures  e g   verb forms   limited varieties of sentence types  e g   imperatives  questions   omissions of critical parts of sentences  use of unusual word order  and slow rate of language development  Nonlinguistic functioning  as measured by performance intelligence tests  and language comprehension skills are usually within normal limits  Expressive Language Disorder may be either acquired or developmental  In the acquired type  an impairment in expressive language occurs after a period of normal development as a result of a neurological or other general medical condition  e g   encephalitis  head trauma  irradiation   In the developmental type  there is an impairment in expressive language that is not associated with a neurological insult of known origin  Children with this type often begin speaking late and progress more slowly than usual through the various stages of expressive language development 315 31 Mixed Receptive-Expressive Language DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Mixed Receptive-Expressive Language Disorder is an impairment in both receptive and expressive language development as demonstrated by scores on standardized individually administered measures of both receptive and expressive language development that are substantially below those obtained from standardized measures of nonverbal intellectual capacity  Criterion A   The difficulties may occur in communication involving both verbal language and sign language  The language difficulties interfere with academic or occupational achievement or with social communication  Criterion B   and the symptoms do not meet criteria for a Pervasive Develop- mental Disorder  Criterion C   If Mental Retardation  a speech-motor or sensory deficit  or environmental deprivation is present  the language difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with these problems  Criterion D   If a speech-motor or sensory deficit or neurological condition is present  it should be coded on AxisIII An individual with this disorder has the difficulties associated with Expressive Language Disorder  e g   a markedly limited vocabulary  errors in tense  difficulty recalling words or producing sentences with developmentally appropriate length or complexity  and general difficulty expressing ideas  and also has impairment in receptive language development  e g   difficulty understanding words  sentences  or specific types of words   In mild cases  there may be difficulties only in understanding particular types of words  e g   spatial terms  or statements  e g   complex "if-then" sentences   In more severe cases  there may be multiple disabilities  including an inability to understand basic vocabulary or simple sentences  and deficits in various areas of auditory processing  e g   discrimination of sounds  association of sounds and symbols  storage  recall  and sequencing   Because the development of expressive language in childhood relies on the acquisition of receptive skills  a pure receptive language disorder  analogous to a Wernicke's aphasia in adults  is virtually never seen Mixed Receptive-Expressive Language Disorder may be either acquired or develop- mental  In the acquired type  an impairment in receptive and expressive language occurs after a period of normal development as a result of a neurological or other general medical condition  e g   encephalitis  head trauma  irradiation   In the developmental type  there is an impairment in receptive and expressive language that is not associated with a neurological insult of known origin  This type is characterized by a slow rate of language development in which speech may begin late and advance slowly through the stages of language development 307 0 StutteringDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Stuttering is a disturbance in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech that is inappropriate for the individual's age  Criterion A   This disturbance is characterized by frequent repetitions or prolongations of sounds or syllables  Criteria Al and A2   Various other types of speech dysfluencies may also be involved  including interjections  Criterion A3   broken words  e g   pauses within a word   Criterion A4   audible or silent blocking  filled or unfilled pauses in speech   Criterion A5   circumlocutions  i e   word substitutions to avoid problematic words   Criterion A6   words produced with an excess of physical tension  Criterion A7   and monosyllabic whole word repetitions  e g   "I-I-I-I see him"   Criterion A8   The disturbance in fluency interferes with academic or occupational achievement or with social communication  Criterion B   If a speech-motor or sensory deficit is present  the speech difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with these problems  Criterion C   If a speech-motor or sensory deficit or neurological disorder is present  this condition should also be coded on Axis III  The extent of the disturbance varies from situation to situation and often is more severe when there is special pressure to communicate  e g   giving a report at school  interviewing for a job   Stuttering is often absent during oral reading  singing  or talking to inanimate objects or to pets 307 9 Communication Disorder Not Otherwise SpecifiedThis category is for disorders in communication that do not meet criteria for any specific Communication Disorder  for example  a voice disorder  i e   an abnormality of vocal pitch  loudness  quality  tone  or resonance  

299 00 Autistic DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of Autistic Disorder are the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activity and interests  Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the developmental level and chronological age of the individual  Autistic Disorder is sometimes referred to as early infantile autism  childhood autism  or Kanner's autism The impairment in reciprocal social interaction is gross and sustained  There may be marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors  e g   eye-to-eye gaze  facial expression  body postures and gestures  to regulate social interaction and communication  Criterion Ala   There may be failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level  Criterion Alb  that may take different forms at different ages  Younger individuals may have little or no interest in establishing friendships  Older individuals may have an interest in friendship but lack understanding of the conventions of social interaction  There may be a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment  interests  or achievements with other people  e g   not showing  bringing  or pointing out objects they find interesting   CriterionAle   Lack of social or emotional reciprocity may be present  e g   not actively participating in simple social play or games  preferring solitary activities  or involving others in activities only as tools or "mechanical" aids   Criterion Aid   Often an individual's awareness of others is markedly impaired  Individuals with this disorder may be oblivious to other children  including siblings   may have no concept of the needs of others  or may not notice another person's distress The impairment in communication is also marked and sustained and affects both verbal and nonverbal skills  There may be delay in  or total lack of  the development of spoken language  Criterion A2a   In individuals who do speak  there may be marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others  Criterion A2b   or a stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language  Criterion A2c   There may also be a lack of varied  spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level  Criterion A2d   When speech does develop  the pitch  intonation  rate  rhythm  or stress may be abnormal  e g   tone of voice may be monotonous or contain question like rises at ends of statements   Grammatical structures are often immature and include stereotyped and repetitive use of language  e g   repetition of words or phrases regardless of meaning  repeating jingles or commercials  or metaphorical language  i e   language that can only be understood clearly by those familiar with the individual's communication style   A disturbance in the comprehension of language may be evidenced by an inability to understand simple questions  directions  or jokes  Imaginative play is often absent or markedly impaired 
These individuals also tend not to engage in the simple imitation games or routines of infancy or early childhood or do so only out of context or in a mechanical way Individuals with Autistic Disorder have restricted  repetitive  and stereotyped patterns of behavior  interests  and activities  There may be an encompassing pre- occupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus  Criterion A3a   an apparently inflexible adherence to specific  nonfunctional routines or rituals  Criterion A3b   stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms  Criterion A3c   or a persistent preoccupation with parts of objects  Criterion A3d   Individuals with Autistic Disorder display a markedly restricted range of interests and are often preoccupied with one narrow interest  e g   with amassing facts about meteorology or baseball statistics   They may line up an exact number of play things in the same manner over and over again or repetitively mimic the actions of a television actor  They may insist on sameness and show resistance to or distress over trivial changes  e g   a younger child may have a catastrophic reaction to a minor change in the environment such as a new set of curtains or a change in place at the dinner table   There is often an interest in nonfunctional routines or rituals or an unreasonable insistence on following routines  e g   taking exactly the same route to school every day  Stereotyped body movements include the hands  clapping  finger flicking  or whole body  rocking  dipping  and swaying   Abnormalities of posture  e g   walking on tiptoe  odd hand movements and body postures  may be present  These individuals show a persistent preoccupation with parts of objects  buttons  parts of the body   There may also be a fascination with movement  e g   the spinning wheels of toys  the opening and closing of doors  an electric fan or other rapidly revolving object   The person may be highly attached to some inanimate object  e g   a piece of string or a rubber band  The disturbance must be manifest by delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas prior to age 3 years  social interaction  language as used in social communication  or symbolic or imaginative play  Criterion B   There is typically no period of unequivocally normal development  although 1 or 2 years of relatively normal development has been reported in some instances  In a minority of cases  parents report regression in language development  generally manifest as the cessation of speech after a child has acquired from 5 to 10 words  By definition  if there is a period of normal development  it cannot extend past age 3 years  The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder  Criterion C  299 80 Rett's DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Rett's Disorder is the development of multiple specific deficits following a period of normal functioning after birth  Individuals have an apparently normal prenatal and perinatal period  CriterionAl  with normal psychomotor develop- ment through the first 5 months of life  Criterion A2   Head circumference at birth is also within normal limits  Criterion A3   Between ages 5 and 48 months  head growth decelerates  Criterion Bl   There is a loss of previously acquired purposeful hand skills between ages 5 and 30 months  with the subsequent development of characteristic stereotyped hand movements resembling hand-wringing or hand washing  Criterion B2   Interest in the social environment diminishes in the first few years after the onset of the disorder  Criterion B3   although social interaction may often develop later in the course  Problems develop in the coordination of gait or trunk movements  CriterionB4   There is also severe impairment in expressive and receptive language development  with severe psychomotor retardation  Criterion B5  299 10 Childhood Disintegrative DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Childhood Disintegrative Disorder is a marked regression in multiple areas of functioning following a period of at least 2 years of apparently normal development  Criterion A   Apparently normal development is reflected in age- appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication  social relationships  play  and adaptive behavior  After the first 2 years of life  but before age 10 years   the child has a clinically significant loss of previously acquired skills in at least two of the following areas  expressive or receptive language  social skills or adaptive behavior  bowel or bladder control  play  or motor skills  Criterion B   Individuals with this disorder exhibit the social and communicative deficits and behavioral features generally observed in Autistic Disorder  see p  66   There is qualitative impairment in social interaction  Criterion Cl  and in communication  Criterion C2   and restricted  repetitive  and stereotyped patterns of behavior  interests  and activities  Criterion C3   The disturbance is not better accounted for by another specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder or by Schizophrenia  Criterion D   This condition has also been termed Heller's syndrome  dementia infantilis  or disintegrativepsychosis 299 80 Asperger's DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of Asperger's Disorder are severe and sustained impairment in social interaction  Criterion A  and the development of restricted  repetitive patterns of behavior  interests  and activities  Criterion B   see p  66 in Autistic Disorder for a discussion of Criteria A and B   The disturbance must cause clinically significant impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning Criterion C   In contrast to Autistic Disorder  there are no clinicallysignificant delays in language  e g   single words are used by age 2 years  communicative phrases are used by age 3 years   Criterion D   In addition  there are no clinically significant delays in cognitive development or in the development of age-appropriate self-help skills  adaptive behavior  other than in social interaction   and curiosity about the environment in childhood  Criterion E   The diagnosis is not given if the criteria are met for any other specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder or for Schizophrenia  CriterionF  
299 80 Pervasive Developmental DisorderNot Otherwise Specified  Including Atypical Autism This category should be used when there is a severe and pervasive impairment in the development of reciprocal social interaction or verbal and nonverbal communication skills  or when stereotyped behavior  interests  and activities are present  but the criteria are not met for a specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder  Schizophrenia  Schizotypal Personality Disorder  or Avoidant Personality Disorder  For example  this category includes "atypical autism"â€”presentations that do not meet the criteria for Autistic Disorder because of late age at onset  atypical symptomatology  or subthreshold symptomatology  or all of these 
Attention-Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequent and severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development  Criterion A   Some hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms that cause impairment must have been present before age 7 years  although many individuals are diagnosed after the symptoms have been present for a number of years  Criterion B   Some impairment from the symptoms must be present in at least two settings  e g   at home and at school or work   Criterion C   There must be clear evidence of interference with developmentally appropriate social  academic  or occupational functioning  Criterion D   The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a Pervasive Developmental Disorder  Schizophrenia  or other Psychotic Disorder and is not better accounted for by another mental disorder  e g   a Mood Disorder  Anxiety Disorder  Dissociative Disorder  or Personality Disorder   CriterionE  Inattention may be manifest in academic  occupational  or social situations  Individuals with this disorder may fail to give close attention to details or may make careless mistakes in schoolwork or other tasks  Criterion Ala   Work is often messy and performed carelessly and without considered thought  Individuals often have difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities and find it hard to persist with tasks until completion  Criterion Alb   They often appear as if their mind is elsewhere or as if they are not listening or did not hear what has just been said  Criterion Ale   There may be frequent shifts from one uncompleted activity to another  Individuals diagnosed with this disorder may begin a task  move on to another  then turn to yet something else  prior to completing any one task  They often do not follow through on requests or instructions and fail to complete schoolwork  chores  or other duties  Criterion Aid   Failure to complete tasks should be considered in making this diagnosis only if it is due to inattention as opposed to other possible reasons  e g   a failure to understand instructions   These individuals often have difficulties organizing tasks and activities  Criterion Ale   Tasks that require sustained mental effort are experienced as unpleasant and markedly aversive  As a result  these individuals typically avoid or have a strong dislike for activities that demand sustained self-application and mental effort or that require organizational demands or close concentration  e g   homework or paperwork   Criterion AID  This avoidance must be due to the person's difficulties with attention and not due to a primary oppositional attitude  although secondary oppositionalism may also occur  Work habits are often disorganized and the materials necessary for doingthe task are often scattered  lost  or carelessly handled and damaged  Criterion Alg   Individuals with this disorder are easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli and frequently interrupt ongoing tasks to attend to trivial noises or events that are usually and easily ignored by others  e g   a car honking  a background conversation   Criterion Alh   They are often forgetful in daily activities  e g   missing appointments  forgetting to bring lunch   Criterion Ali   In social situations  inattention may be expressed as frequent shifts in conversation  not listening to others  not keeping one's mind on conversations  and not following details or rules of games or activities Hyperactivity may be manifested by fidgetiness or squirming in one's seat  Criterion A2a   by not remaining seated when expected to do so  Criterion A2b   by excessive running or climbing in situations where it is inappropriate  Criterion A2c   by having difficulty playing or engaging quietly in leisure activities  Criterion A2d   by appearing to be often "on the go" or as if "driven by a motor"  Criterion A2e   or by talking excessively  Criterion A2f   Hyperactivity may vary with the individual's age and developmental level  and the diagnosis should be made cautiously in young children  Toddlers and preschoolers with this disorder differ from normally active young children by being constantly on the go and into everything  they dart back and forth  are "out of the door before their coat is on " jump or climb on furniture  run through the house  and have difficulty participating in sedentary group activities in preschool classes  e g   listening to a story   School-age children display similar behaviors but usually with less frequency or intensity than toddlers and preschoolers  They have difficulty remaining seated  get up frequently  and squirm in  or hang on to the edge of  their seat  They fidget with objects  tap their hands  and shake their feet or legs excessively  They often get up from the table during meals  while watching television  or while doing homework  they talk excessively  and they make excessive noise during quiet activities  In adolescents and adults  symptoms of hyperactivity take the form of feelings of restless- ness and difficulty engaging in quiet sedentary activities Impulsivity manifests itself as impatience  difficulty in delaying responses  blurting out answers before questions have been completed  Criterion A2g   difficulty awaiting one's turn  Criterion A2h   and frequently interrupting or intruding on others to the point of causing difficulties in social  academic  or occupational settings  Criterion A2i   Others may complain that they cannot get a word in edgewise  Individuals with this disorder typically make comments out of turn  fail to listen to directions  initiate conversations at inappropriate times  interrupt others excessively  intrude on others  grab objects from others  touch things they are not supposed to touch  and clown around  Impulsivity may lead to accidents  e g   knocking over objects  banging into people  grabbing a hot pan  and to engagement in potentially dangerous activities without consideration of possible consequences  e g   riding a skateboard over extremely rough terrain  Behavioral manifestations usually appear in multiple contexts  including home  school  work  and social situations  To make the diagnosis  some impairment must be present in at least two settings  Criterion C   It is very unusual for an individual to display the same level of dysfunction in all settings or within the same setting at all times  Symptoms typically worsen in situations that require sustained attention or mental effort or that lack intrinsic appeal or novelty  e g   listening to classroom teachers  doing class assignments  listening to or reading lengthy materials  or working on monotonous  repetitive tasks   Signs of the disorder may be minimal or absent when the person is under very strict control  is in a novel setting  is engaged in especially interesting activities  is in a one-to-one situation  e g   the clinician's office   or while the person experiences frequent rewards for appropriate behavior  The symptoms are more likely
80 Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy  Childhood  or Adolescenceto occur in group situations  e g   in playgroups  classrooms  or work environments   The clinician should therefore inquire about the individual's behavior in a variety of situations within each setting 312 8 Conduct DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Conduct Disorder is a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated  Criterion A   These behaviors fall into four main groupings  aggressive conduct that causes or threatens physical harm to other people or animals  Criteria A1-A7   nonaggressive conduct that causes property loss or damage  Criteria A8â€”A9   deceitful- ness or theft  Criteria A10-A12   and serious violations of rules  Criteria A13-A15   Three  or more  characteristic behaviors must have been present during the past 12 months  with at least one behavior present in the past 6 months  The disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social  academic  or occupational functioning  Criterion B   Conduct Disorder may be diagnosed in individuals who are older than age 18 years  but only if the criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder are not met  Criterion C   The behavior pattern is usually present in a variety of settings such as home  school  or the community  Because individuals with Conduct Disorder are likely to minimize their conduct problems  the clinician often must rely on additional informants  However  the informant's knowledge of the child's conduct problems may be limited by inadequate supervision or by the child's not having revealed them Children or adolescents with this disorder often initiate aggressive behavior and react aggressively to others  They may display bullying  threatening  or intimidating behavior  Criterion Al   initiate frequent physical fights  Criterion A2   use a weapon that can cause serious physical harm  e g   a bat  brick  broken bottle  knife  or gun   Criterion A3   be physically cruel to people  Criterion A4  or animals  Criterion A5   steal while confronting a victim  e g   mugging  purse snatching  extortion  or armed robbery   Criterion A6   or force someone into sexual activity  Criterion A7   Physical violence may take the form of rape  assault  or in rare cases  homicide Deliberate destruction of others' property is a characteristic feature of this disorder and may include deliberate fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage  Criterion A8  or deliberately destroying other people's property in other ways  e g   smashing car windows  school vandalism   Criterion A9  Deceitfulness or theft is common and may include breaking into someone else's house  building  or car  Criterion A10   frequently lying or breaking promises to obtain goods or favors or to avoid debts or obligations  e g   "conning" other people   Criterion Al 1   or stealing items of nontrivial value without confronting the victim  e g   shoplifting  forgery   Criterion A12  Characteristically  there are also serious violations of rules  e g   school  parental  by individuals with this disorder  Children with this disorder often have a pattern  beginning before age 13 years  of staying out late at night despite parental prohibitions  Criterion A13   There may be a pattern of running away from home overnight  Criterion A14   To be considered a symptom of Conduct Disorder  the running away must have occurred at least twice  or only once if the individual did not return for a lengthy period   Runaway episodes that occur as a direct consequence of physical or sexual abuse do not typically qualify for this criterion  Children with this disorder may often be truant from school  beginning prior to age 13 years  Criterion A15   In older individuals  this behavior is manifested by often being absent from work without good reason 313 81 Oppositional Defiant DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Oppositional Defiant Disorder is a recurrent pattern of negativistic  defiant  disobedient  and hostile behavior toward authority figures that persists for at least 6 months  Criterion A  and is characterized by the frequent occurrence of at least four of the following behaviors  losing temper  Criterion Al   arguing with adults  Criterion A2   actively defying or refusing to comply with the requests or rules of adults  Criterion A3   deliberately doing things that will annoy other people  Criterion A4   blaming others for his or her own mistakes or misbehavior  Criterion A5   being touchy or easily annoyed by others  Criterion A6   being angry and resentful  Criterion A7   or being spiteful or vindictive  Criterion A8   To qualify for Oppositional Defiant Disorder  the behaviors must occur more frequently than is typically observed in individuals of comparable age and developmental level and must lead to significant impairment in social  academic  or occupational functioning  Criterion B   The diagnosis is not made if the disturbance in behavior occurs exclusively during the course of a Psychotic or Mood Disorder  Criterion C  or if criteria are met for Conduct Disorder or Antisocial Personality Disorder  in an individual over age 18 years  Negativistic and defiant behaviors are expressed by persistent stubbornness  resistance to directions  and unwillingness to compromise  give in  or negotiate with adults or peers  Defiance may also include deliberate or persistent testing of limits  usually by ignoring orders  arguing  and failing to accept blame for misdeeds  Hostility can be directed at adults or peers and is shown by deliberately annoying others or by verbal aggression  usually without the more serious physical aggression seen in Conduct Disorder   Manifestations of the disorder are almost invariably present in the home setting  but may not be evident at school or in the community  Symptoms of the disorder are typically more evident in interactions with adults or peers whom the individual knows well  and thus may not be apparent during clinical examination  Usually individuals with this disorder do not regard themselves as oppositional or defiant  but justify their behavior as a response to unreasonable demands or circumstances 307 53 Rumination DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Rumination Disorder is the repeated regurgitation and rechewing of food that develops in an infant or child after a period of normal functioning and lasts for at least 1 month  Criterion A   Partially digested food is brought up into the mouth without apparent nausea  retching  disgust  or associated gastrointestinal disorder  The food is then either ejected from the mouth or  more frequently  chewed and reswallowed  The symptoms are not due to an associated gastrointestinal or other general medical condition  e g   Sandifer's syndrome  esophageal reflux   Criterion B  and do not occur exclusively during the course of Anorexia Nervosa or Bulimia Nervosa  If the symptoms occur exclusively during the course of Mental Retardation or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder  they must be sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention
 Criterion C   The disorder is most commonly observed in infants but may be seen in older individuals  particularly those who also have Mental Retardation Infants with the disorder display a characteristic position of straining and arching the back with the head held back  make sucking movements with their tongues  and give the impression of gaining satisfaction from the activity 307 23 Tourette's DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of Tourette's Disorder are multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics  Criterion A   These may appear simultaneously or at different periods during the illness  The tics occur many times a day recurrently throughout a period of more than 1 year  Criterion B   During this period  there is never a tic-free period of more than 3 consecutive months  The disturbance causes marked distress or significant impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning Criterion C   The onset of the disorder is before age 18 years  Criterion D   The tics are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   stimulants  or a general medical condition  e g   Huntington's disease or postviral encephalitis   Criterion E  The anatomical location  number  frequency  complexity  and severity of the tics change over time  The tics typically involve the head and  frequently  other parts of the body  such as the torso and upper and lower limbs  The vocal tics include various words or sounds such as clicks  grunts  yelps  barks  sniffs  snorts  and coughs  Coprolalia  a complex vocal tic involving the uttering of obscenities  is present in a few individuals  less than 10%  with this disorder  Complex motor tics involving touching  squatting deep knee bends  retracing steps  and twirling when walking may be present  In approximately one-half the individuals with this disorder  the first symptoms to appear are bouts of a single tic  most frequently eye blinking  less frequently tics involving another part of the face or the body  Initial symptoms can also include tongue protrusion  squatting  sniffing  hopping  skipping  throat clearing  stuttering  uttering sounds orwords  and coprolalia  The other cases begin with multiple symptoms 307 21 Transient Tic DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Transient Tic Disorder is the presence of single or multiple motor tics and/or vocal tics  Criterion A   The tics occur many times a day  nearly every day for at least 4 weeks  but for no longer than 12 consecutive months  Criterion B   The other essential features  Criteria C  D  and E  are the same as for Tourette's Disorder  Transient Tic Disorder is not diagnosed if the criteria for Tourette's Disorder or Chronic Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder  both of which require a duration of at least 1 year  have ever been met  Criterion F   The other characteristics of the disorder are generally the same as for Tourette's Disorder  see p  101   except that the severity of the symptoms and the functional impairment are usually much less SpecifiersThe course of Transient Tic Disorder may be indicated by specifying Single Episode or Recurrent 307 20 Tic Disorder Not Otherwise SpecifiedThis category is for disorders characterized by tics that do not meet criteria for a specific Tic Disorder  Examples include tics lasting less than 4 weeks or tics with an onset after age 18 years 
Diagnostic FeaturesElimination Disorders EncopresisThe essential feature of Encopresis is repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places  e g   clothing or floor   Criterion A   Most often this is involuntary but occasionally may be intentional  The event must occur at least once a month for at least 3 months  Criterion B   and the chronological age of the child must be at least 4 years  or for children with developmental delays  a mental age of at least 4 years   Criterion C   The fecal incontinence must not be due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   laxatives  or a general medical condition except through a mechanism involving constipation  CriterionD  When the passage of feces is involuntary rather than intentional  it is often related to constipation  impaction  and retention with subsequent overflow  The constipation may develop for psychological reasons  e g   anxiety about defecating in a particular place or a more general pattern of anxious or oppositional behavior  leading to avoidance of defecation  Physiological predispositions to constipation include dehydration associated with a febrile illness  hypothyroidism  or a medication side effect  Once constipation has developed  it may be complicated by an anal fissure  painful defecation  and further fecal retention  The consistency of the stool may vary  In some individuals it may be of normal or near-normal consistency  It may be liquid in other individuals who have overflow incontinence secondary to fecal retention 309 21 Separation Anxiety DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Separation Anxiety Disorder is excessive anxiety concerning separation from the home or from those to whom the person is attached  Criterion A   This anxiety is beyond that which is expected for the individual's developmental level  The disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks  Criterion B   begin before age 18 years  Criterion C   and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  academic  occupational   or other important areas of functioning  Criterion D   The diagnosis is not made if the anxiety occurs exclusively during the course of a Pervasive Developmental Disorder  Schizophrenia  or other Psychotic Disorder or  in adolescents or adults  if it is better accounted for by Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia  Criterion E  Individuals with this disorder may experience recurrent excessive distress on separation from home or major attachment figures  Criterion Al   When separated from attachment figures  they often need to know their whereabouts and need to stay in touch with them  e g   by telephone calls   Some individuals become extremely homesick and uncomfortable to the point of misery when away from home  They may yearn to return home and be preoccupied with reunion fantasies  When separated from major attachment figures  these individuals are often preoccupied with fears that accidents or illness will befall the attachment figures or themselves  CriterionA2   Children with this disorder often express fear of being lost and never being reunited with their parents  Criterion A3   They are often uncomfortable when traveling independently away from the house or from other familiar areas and may avoid going places by themselves  They may be reluctant or refuse to attend school or camp  to visit or sleep at friends' homes  or to go on errands  Criterion A4   These children may be unable to stay in a room by themselves and may display "clinging"behavior  staying close to and "shadowing" the parent around the house  Criterion A5  Children with this disorder often have difficulty at bedtime and may insist that someone stay with them until they fall asleep  Criterion A6   During the night  they may make their way to their parents' bed  or that of another significant person  such as a sibling   if entry to the parental bedroom is barred  they may sleep outside the parents' door  There may be nightmares whose content expresses the individual's fears  e g   destruction of the family through fire  murder  or other catastrophe   Criterion A7   Physical complaints  such as stomachaches  headaches  nausea  and vomiting are common when separation occurs or is anticipated  Criterion A8   Cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations  dizziness  and feeling faint are rare in younger children but may occur in older individuals 
313 23 Selective Mutism formerly Elective Mutism  Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Selective Mutism is the persistent failure to speak in specific social situations  e g   school  with playmates  where speaking is expected  despite speaking in other situations  Criterion A   The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social communication  Criterion B   The distur- bance must last for at least 1 month and is not limited to the first month of school  during which many children may be shy and reluctant to speak   Criterion C   Selective Mutism should not be diagnosed if the individual's failure to speak is due solely to a lack of knowledge of  or comfort with  the spoken language required in the social situation  Criterion D   It is also not diagnosed if the disturbance is better accounted for by embarrassment related to having a Communication Disorder  e g   Stuttering  or if it occurs exclusively during a Pervasive Developmental Disorder  Schizophrenia  or other Psychotic Disorder  Criterion E   Instead of communicating by standard verbalization  children with this disorder may communicate by gestures  nodding or shaking the head  or pulling or pushing  or  in some cases  by monosyllabic  short  or monotone utterances  or in an altered voice 
313 89 Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy or EarlyChildhoodDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Reactive Attachment Disorder is markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts that begins before age 5 years and is associated with grossly pathological care  Criterion A   There are two types of presentations  In the Inhibited Type  the child persistently fails to initiate and to respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate way  The child shows a pattern of excessively inhibited  hypervigilant  or highly ambivalent responses  e g   frozen watchfulness  resistance to comfort  or a mixture of approach and avoidance   Criterion Al   In the Disinhibited Type  there is a pattern of diffuse attachments  The child exhibits indiscriminate sociability or a lack of selectivity in the choice of attachment figures  Criterion A2   The disturbance is not accounted for solely by developmental delay  e g   as in Mental Retardation  and does not meet criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder  Criterion B   By definition  the condition is associated with grossly pathological care that may take the form of persistent disregard of the child's basic emotional needs for comfort  stimulation  and affection  Criterion Cl   persistent disregard of the child's basic physical needs  Criterion C2  or repeated changes of primary caregiver that prevent formation of stable attachments  e g   frequent changes in foster care   Criterion C3  The pathological care is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed social relatedness  Criterion D  307 3 Stereotypic MovementDisorder formerly Stereotypy/Habit Disorder  
Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Stereotypic Movement Disorder is motor behavior that is repetitive  often seemingly driven  and nonfunctional  Criterion A   This motor behavior markedly interferes with normal activities or results in self-inflicted bodily injury that is significant enough to require medical treatment  or would result in such injury if protective measures were not used   Criterion B   If Mental Retardation is present  the stereotypic or self-injurious behavior is sufficiently severe to become a focus of treatment  Criterion C   The behavior is not better accounted for by a compulsion  as in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder   a tic  as in the Tic Disorders   a stereotypy that is part of a Pervasive Developmental Disorder  or hair pulling  as in Trichotillomania  Criterion D   The behavior is also not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition  Criterion E   The motor behaviors must persist for at least 4 weeks  Criterion F  The stereotypic movements may include hand waving  rocking  playing with hands  fiddling with fingers  twirling objects  head banging  self-biting  picking at skin or bodily orifices  or hitting various parts of one's own body  Sometimes the individual uses an object in performing these behaviors  The behaviors may cause permanent and disabling tissue damage and may sometimes be life-threatening  For instance  severe head banging or hitting may lead to cuts  bleeding  infection  retinal detachment  and blindness DeliriumThe disorders in the "Delirium" section share a common symptom presentation of a disturbance in consciousness and cognition  but are differentiated based on etiology  Delirium Due to a General Medical Condition  Substance-Induced Delirium  including medication side effects   and Delirium Due to Multiple Etiologies  In addition  Delirium Not Otherwise Specified is included in this section for presentations in which the clinician is unable to determine a specific etiology for the delirium Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of a delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in cognition that cannot be better accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia  The disturbance develops over a short period of time  usually hours to days  and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day  There is evidence from the history  physical examination  or laboratory tests that the delirium is a direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition  Substance Intoxication or Withdrawal  use of a medication  or toxin exposure  or a Combination of these factors The disturbance in consciousness is manifested by a reduced clarity of awareness of the environment  The ability to focus  sustain  or shift attention is impaired  Criterion A   Questions must be repeated because the individual's attention wanders  or the individual may perseverate with an answer to a previous question rather than appropriately shift attention  The person is easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli  Because of these problems  it may be difficult  or impossible  to engage the person in conversation There is an accompanying change in cognition  which may include memory impairment  disorientation  or language disturbance  or development of a perceptual disturbance  Criterion B   Memory impairment is most commonly evident in recent memory and can be tested by asking the person to remember several unrelated objects or a brief sentence  and then to repeat them after a few minutes of distraction  Disorientation is usually manifested by the individual being disoriented to time  e g   thinking it is morning in the middle of the night  or being disoriented to place  e g   thinking he or she is home rather than in a hospital   In mild delirium  disorientation to time may be the first symptom to appear  Disorientation to self is less common  Language disturbance may be evident as dysnomia  i e   the impaired ability to name objects  or dysgraphia  i e   the impaired ability to write   In some cases  speech is rambling and irrelevant  in others pressured and incoherent  with unpredictable switching from subject to subject  It may be difficult for the clinician to assess for changes in cognitive function because the individual may be inattentive and incoherent  Under these circumstances  it is helpful to review carefully the individual's history and to obtain information from other informants particularly family members Perceptual disturbances may include misinterpretations  illusions  or hallucinations  For example  the banging of a door may be mistaken for a gunshot  misinterpretation   the folds of the bedclothes may appear to be animate objects  illusion   or the person may "see" a group of people hovering over the bed when no one is actually there  hallucination   Although sensory misperceptions are most commonly visual  they may occur in other sensory modalities as well  Misperceptions range from simple and uniform to highly complex  The individual may have a delusional conviction of the reality of the hallucinations and exhibit emotional and behavioral responses in keeping with their content The disturbance develops over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day  Criterion C   For example  during morning hospital rounds  the person may be coherent and cooperative  but at night might insist on pulling out intravenous lines and going home to parents who died years ago 293 0 Delirium Due to a General Medical ConditionDiagnostic and Associated FeaturesThe descriptive features of Delirium Due to a General Medical Condition  Criteria A -C   are discussed on pp  124-125  In addition  to diagnose Delirium Due to a General Medical Condition  there must be evidence from the history  physical examination  or laboratory findings that the cognitive disturbance is the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition  Criterion D  In determining whether the delirium is due to a general medical condition  the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical condition  Further  the clinician must establish that the delirium is etiologically related to the general medical condition  A careful and comprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment  Although there are no infallible guidelines  several considerations provide some guidance in this area  One consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset  exacerbation  or remission of the general medical condition and that of the delirium  Evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a direct association between the general medical condition in question and the development of a delirium can provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation  In addition  the clinician must also judge that the disturbance is not better accounted for by a Substance-Induced Delirium or a primary mental disorder  e g   a Manic Episode   This determination is explained in greater detail in the "Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition" section  p  165  Delirium can be associated with many different general medical conditions  each of which has characteristic physical examination and laboratory findings  In systemic illnesses  focal neurological signs are not usually found  Various forms of tremor may be present  Asterixis  a flapping movement of the hyperextended hands  was originally described in hepatic encephalopathy but may also be found in association with other causes of delirium  Signs of autonomic hyperactivity  e g   tachycardia  sweating  flushed face  dilated pupils  and elevated blood pressure  commonly occur  In addition to laboratory findings that are characteristic of etiological general medical conditions  or intoxication or withdrawal states   the EEG is generally abnormal  showing either generalized slowing or fast activity 

134 Delirium  Dementia  and Amnestic and Other Cognitive DisordersDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of a dementia is the development of multiple cognitive deficits that include memory impairment and at least one of the following cognitive disturbances  aphasia  apraxia  agnosia  or a disturbance in executive functioning  The cognitive deficits must be sufficiently severe to cause impairment in occupational or social functioning and must represent a decline from a previously higher level of functioning  A diagnosis of a dementia should not be made if the cognitive deficits occur exclusively during the course of a delirium  However  a dementia and a delirium may both be diagnosed if the dementia is present at times when the delirium is not present  Dementia may be etiologically related to a general medical condition  to the persisting effects of substance use  including toxin exposure   or to a combination of these factors Memory impairment is required to make the diagnosis of a dementia and is a prominent early symptom  Criterion Al   Individuals with dementia become impaired in their ability to learn new material  or they forget previously learned material  Most individuals with dementia have both forms of memory impairment  although it is sometimes difficult to demonstrate the loss of previously learned material early in the course of the disorder  They may lose valuables like wallets and keys  forget food cooking on the stove  and become lost in unfamiliar neighborhoods  In advanced stages of dementia  memory impairment is so severe that the person forgets his or her occupation  schooling  birthday  family members  and sometimes even name Memory may be formally tested by asking the person to register  retain  recall  and recognize information  The ability to learn new information may be assessed by asking the individual to learn a list of words  The individual is requested to repeat the words  registration   to recall the information after a delay of several minutes  retention  recall   and to recognize the words from a multiple list  recognition   Individuals with difficulty learning new information are not helped by clues or prompts  e g   multiple-choice questions  because they did not learn the material initially  In contrast  individuals with primarily retrieval deficits can be helped by clues and prompts because their impairment is in the ability to access their memories  Remote memory may be tested by asking the individual to recall personal information or past material that the individual found of interest  e g   politics  sports  entertainment   It is also useful to determine  from the individual and informants  the impact of the memory disturbances on the individual's functioning  e g   ability to work  shop  cook  pay bills  return home without getting lost  Deterioration of language function  aphasia  may be manifested by difficulty producing the names of individuals and objects  Criterion A2a   The speech of individuals with aphasia may become vague or empty  with long circumlocutory phrases and excessive use of terms of indefinite reference such as "thing" and "it " Comprehension of spoken and written language and repetition of language may also be compromised  In the advanced stages of dementia  individuals may be mute or have a deteriorated speech pattern characterized by echolalia  i e   echoing what is heard  or palilalia  i e   repeating sounds or words over and over   Language is tested by asking the individual to name objects in the room  e g   tie  dress  desk  lamp  or body parts  e g   nose  chin  shoulder   follow commands  "Point at the door and then at the table"   or repeat phrases  "no ifs  ands  or buts"  Individuals with dementia may exhibit apraxia  i e   impaired ability to execute motor activities despite intact motor abilities  sensory function  and comprehension of the required task   Criterion A2b   They will be impaired in their ability to pantomime the use of objects  e g   combing hair  or to execute known motor acts  e g   waving
goodbye   Apraxia may contribute to deficits in cooking  dressing  and drawing  Motor skill disturbances may be tested by asking the individual to execute motor functions  e g   to show how to brush teeth  to copy intersecting pentagons  to assemble blocks  or to arrange sticks in specific designs  Individuals with dementia may exhibit agnosia  i e   failure to recognize or identify objects despite intact sensory function   Criterion A2c   For example  the individual may have normal visual acuity but lose the ability to recognize objects such as chairs or pencils  Eventuallythey may be unable to recognize family members or even their own reflection in the mirror  Similarly  they may have normal tactile sensation  but be unable to identify objects placed in their hands by touch alone  e g   a coin or keys  Disturbances in executive functioning are a common manifestation of dementia  Criterion A2d  and may be related especially to disorders of the frontal lobe or associated subcortical pathways  Executive functioning involves the ability to think abstractly and to plan  initiate  sequence  monitor  and stop complex behavior  Impairment in abstract thinking may be manifested by the individual having difficulty coping with novel tasks and avoiding situations that require the processing of new and complex information  The ability to abstract can be formally assessed by asking the person to find similarities or differences between related words  Executive dysfunction is also evident in a reduced ability to shift mental sets  to generate novel verbal or nonverbal information  and to execute serial motor activities  Tests for executive function include asking the individual to count to 10  recite the alphabet  subtract serial 7s  state as many animals as possible in 1 minute  or draw a continuous line consisting of alternating m's and n's  It is also useful to determine  from the individual and informants  the impact of the disturbances in executive functioning on the individual's daily life  e g   ability to work  plan activities  budget  The items in both Criterion Al  memory impairment  and Criterion A2  aphasia  apraxia  agnosia  or disturbance in executive functioning  must be severe enough to cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning  e g   going to school  working  shopping  dressing  bathing  handling finances  and other activities of daily living  and must represent a decline from a previous level of functioning  Criterion B   The nature and degree of impairment are variable and often depend on the particular social setting of the individual  The same level of cognitive impairment may significantly impair an individual's ability to perform a complex job but not a job that is less demanding  Standardized published rating scales that measure physical maintenance  e g   personal hygiene   intellectual functioning  and the ability to use implements or tools  e g   telephone  washing machine  can be used to measure the severity of impairment Dementia is not diagnosed if these symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium  However  a delirium may be superimposed on a preexisting dementia  in which case both diagnoses should be given 
Dementia of the Alzheimer's TypeDiagnostic FeaturesThe cognitive deficits  Criterion A  and the required impairment  Criterion B  are discussed on pp  133-135  The onset of Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type is gradual and involves continuing cognitive decline  Criterion C   Because of the difficulty of obtaining direct pathological evidence of the presence of Alzheimer's disease  the diagnosis can be made only when other etiologies for the dementia have been ruled out  Specifically  the cognitive deficits are not due to other central nervous system conditions that cause progressive deficits in memory or cognition  e g   cerebrovascular disease  Parkinson's disease  Huntington's disease   systemic conditions that are known to cause dementia  e g   hypothyroidism  vitamin B12 deficiency  HIV infection   or the persisting effects of a substance  e g   alcohol   Criterion D   If there is an additional etiology  e g   head trauma worsening a Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type   both types of dementia should be coded  see Dementia Due to Multiple Etiologies  p  154   Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type should not be diagnosed if the symptoms occur exclusively during delirium  Criterion E   However  delirium may be superimposed on a preexisting Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type  in which case the With Delirium subtype should be indicated  Finally  the cognitive deficits are not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder  e g   Major Depressive Disorder or Schizophrenia   Criterion F  290 4x Vascular DementiaMulti-Infarct Dementia The cognitive deficits  Criterion A  and the required impairment  Criterion B  in Vascular Dementia are discussed on pp  133-135  There must be evidence of cerebrovascular disease  i e   focal neurological signs and symptoms or laboratory evidence Diagnostic Featuresjudged to be etiologically related to the dementia  Criterion C   The focal neurological signs and symptoms include extensor plantar response  pseudobulbar palsy  gait abnormalities  exaggeration of deep tendon reflexes  or weakness of an extremity  Computed tomography  CT  of the head and magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  usually demonstrate multiple vascular lesions of the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures  Vascular Dementia is not diagnosed if the symptoms occur exclusively during delirium  Criterion D   However  delirium may be superimposed on a preexisting Vascular Dementia  in which case the subtype With Delirium should be indicated 294 1 Dementia Due to Huntington's DiseaseThe essential feature of Dementia Due to Huntington's Disease is the presence of a dementia that is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of Huntington's disease  Huntington's disease is an inherited progressive degenerative disease of cognition  emotion  and movement  The disease affects men and women equally and is transmitted by a single autosomal dominant gene on the short arm of chromosome 4  The disease is usually diagnosed in the late 30s to early 40s but may begin as early as age 4 years in the juvenile form or as late as age 85 years in the late-onset form  The onset of Huntington's disease is often heralded by insidious changes in behavior and personality  including depression  irritability  and anxiety  Some individuals present with abnormalities of movement that resemble increased fidgeting and that later progress to characteristic generalized choreoathetosis  Difficulties with memory retrieval  executive functioning  and judgment are common early in the course  with more severe memory deficits occurring as the disease progresses  Disorganized speech and psychotic features are sometimes present  Late in the disease  characteristic "boxcar ventricles"may be seen on structural brain imaging due to the atrophy of the striatum  Positron-emission tomography  PET  may show striatal hypometabolism early in the disease  Offspring of individuals with Huntington's disease have a 50% chance of developing the disease  A genetic test is available to determine with relative certainty whether a given at-risk individual is likely to develop the disease  however  such testing may be best administered by centers with experience in counseling and follow-up of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease 290 10 Dementia Due to Pick's DiseaseThe essential feature of Dementia Due to Pick's Disease is the presence of a dementia that is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of Pick's disease  Pick's disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that particularly affects the frontal and temporal lobes  As in other frontal lobe dementias  Pick's disease is characterized clinically by changes in personality early in the course  deterioration of social skills  emotional blunting  behavioral disinhibition  and prominent language abnormalities  Difficulties with memory  apraxia  and other features of dementia usually follow later in the course  Prominent primitive reflexes  snout  suck  grasp  may be present  As the dementia progresses  it may be accompanied by either apathy or extreme agitation  Individuals may develop such severe problems in language  attention  or behavior that it may be difficult to assess their degree of cognitive impairment  Structural brain imaging typically reveals prominent frontal and/or temporal atrophy  and functional brain imaging may localize frontotemporal hypometabolism  even in the absence of clear structural atrophy  The disorder most commonly manifests itself in individuals between ages 50 and 60 years  although it can occur among older individuals Pick's disease is one of the pathologically distinct etiologies among the heterogeneous group of dementing processes that are associated with frontotemporal brain atrophy  The specific diagnosis of a frontal lobe dementia such as Pick's disease is usually established at autopsy with the pathological finding of characteristic intraneuronal argentophilic Pick inclusion bodies  Clinically  Pick's disease often cannot be distinguished with certainty from atypical cases of Alzheimer's disease or from other dementias that affect the frontal lobes 
290 10 Dementia Due to Creutzfeldt-Jakob DiseaseThe essential feature of Dementia Due to Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is the presence of a dementia that is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease  Jacob-Creutzfeldt disease is one of the subacute spongiform encephalopathies  a group of central nervous system diseases caused by transmissible agents known as "slow viruses" or prions  Typically individuals with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease manifest the clinical triad of dementia  involuntary movements  particularly myoclonus   and periodic EEC activity  However  up to 25%of individuals with the disorder may have atypical presentations  and the disease can be confirmed only by biopsy or at autopsy with the demonstration of spongiform neuropathological changes  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease may develop at any age in adults  but most typically when they are between ages 40 and 60 years  From 5%to 15% of cases may have a familial component  Prodromal symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease may include fatigue  anxiety  or problems with appetite  sleeping  or concentration and may be followed after several weeks by incoordination  altered vision  or abnormal gait or other movements that may be myoclonic  choreoathetoid  or ballistic  along with a rapidly progressive dementia  The disease typically progresses very rapidly over several months  although more rarely it can progress over years and appear similar in its course to other dementias  There are no distinctive findings on cerebrospinal fluid analysis  and nonspecific atrophy may be apparent on neuroimaging  In most individuals  the EEC typically reveals periodic sharp  often triphasic and synchronous discharges at a rate of 0 5-2 Hz at some point during the course of the disorder  The transmissible agent thought to be responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is resistant to boiling  formalin  alcohol  and ultraviolet radiation  but it can be inactivated by pressured autoclaving or by bleach  Transmission by corneal transplantation and human growth factor injection has been documented  and anecdotal cases of transmission to health care workers have been reported  Therefore  when neurosurgery  brain biopsy  or brain autopsy is undertaken 
universal precautions should be taken with both tissue and equipment that comes in contact with tissue 
293 89 Catatonic Disorder Due to a General Medical ConditionDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Catatonic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition is the presence of catatonia that is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition  Catatonia is manifested by any of the following  motoric immobility  excessive motor activity  extreme negativism or mutism  peculiarities of voluntary movement  echolalia  or echopraxia  Criterion A   There must be evidence from the history  physical examination  or laboratory findings that the catatonia is the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition  Criterion B   The diagnosis is not given if the catatonia is better accounted for by another mental disorder  e g   Manic Episode   Criterion C  or if it occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium  Criterion D  Motoric immobility may be manifested by catalepsy  waxy flexibility  or stupor  The excessive motor activity is apparently purposeless and is not influenced by external stimuli  There may be extreme negativism that is manifested by resistance to all instructions or the maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved  Peculiarities of voluntary movement are manifested by the voluntary assumption of inappropriate or bizarre postures or by prominent grimacing  Echolalia is the pathological  parrotlike  and apparently senseless repetition of a word or phrase just spoken by another person  Echopraxia is the repetitive imitation of the movements of another person 

310 1 Personality ChangeDue to a General Medical ConditionDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of a Personality Change Due to a General Medical Condition is a persistent personality disturbance that is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition  The personality disturbance represents a change from the individual's previous characteristic personality pattern  In children  this condition may be manifested as a marked deviation from normal development rather than as a change in a stable personality pattern  Criterion A   There must be evidence from the history  physical examination  or laboratory findings that the personality change is the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition  Criterion B   The diagnosis is not given if the disturbance is better accounted for by another mental disorder  Criterion C   The diagnosis is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium or if symptoms meet the criteria for a dementia  Criterion D   The disturbance must also cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion E  Common manifestations of the personality change include affective instability  poor impulse control  outbursts of aggression or rage grossly out of proportion to any precipitating psychosocial stressor  marked apathy  suspiciousness  or paranoid ideation  The phenomenology of the change is indicated using the subtypes listed below  An individual with the disorder is often characterized by others as "not himself [or herself] " Although it shares the term "personality" with the Axis II Personality Disorders  this diagnosis is coded on Axis I and is distinct by virtue of its specific etiology  different phenomenology  and more variable onset and course The clinical presentation in a given individual may depend on the nature and localization of the pathological process  For example  injury to the frontal lobes may yield such symptoms as lack of judgment or foresight  facetiousness  disinhibition  and euphoria  Right hemisphere strokes have often been shown to evoke personality changes in association with unilateral spatial neglect  anosognosia  inability of the individual to recognize a bodily or functional deficit such as the existence of hemiparesis   motor impersistence  and other neurological deficits 

293 9 Mental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified Due to a General Medical ConditionThis residual category should be used for situations in which it has been established that the disturbance is caused by the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition  but the criteria are not met for a specific Mental Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  e g   dissociative symptoms due to complex partial seizures  303 90 Alcohol DependenceAlso refer to the text and criteria for Substance Dependence  see p  176   Physiological dependence on alcohol is indicated by evidence of tolerance or symptoms of Withdrawal  Alcohol Withdrawal  see p  197  is characterized by the development of withdrawal symptoms 12 hours or so after the reduction of intake following prolonged  heavy  alcohol ingestion  Because Withdrawal from alcohol can be unpleasant and intense  individuals with Alcohol Dependence may continue to consume alcohol  despite adverse consequences  often to avoid or to relieve the symptoms of withdrawal  A substantial minority of individuals who have Alcohol Dependence never experience clinically relevant levels of Alcohol Withdrawal  and only about 5% of individuals with Alcohol Dependence ever experience severe complications of withdrawal  e g  delirium  grandmal seizures   Once a pattern of compulsive use develops  individuals with Dependence may devote substantial periods of time to obtaining and consuming alcoholic beverages  These individuals often continue to use alcohol despite evidence of adverse psychological or physical consequences  e g   depression  blackouts  liver disease  or other sequelae  305 00 Alcohol AbuseAlso refer to the text and criteria for Substance Abuse  see p  182   School and job performance may suffer either from the aftereffects of drinking or from actual intoxication on the job or at school  child care or household responsibilities may be neglected  and alcohol-related absences may occur from school or job  The person may use alcohol in physically hazardous circumstances  e g   driving an automobile or operating machinery while drunk   Legal difficulties may arise because of alcohol use  e g   arrests for intoxicated behavior or for driving under the influence   Finally  individuals with Alcohol Abuse may continue to consume alcohol despite the knowledge that continued consumption poses significant social or interpersonal problems for them  e g   violent arguments with spouse while intoxicated  child abuse   When these problems are accompanied by evidence of tolerance  withdrawal  or compulsive behavior related to alcohol use  a diagnosis of Alcohol Dependence  rather than Alcohol Abuse  should be considered 
303 00 Alcohol IntoxicationRefer to the text and criteria for Substance Intoxication  see p  183   The essential feature of Alcohol Intoxication is the presence of clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes  e g   inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior  mood lability  impaired judgment  impaired social or occupational functioning  that develop during  or shortly after  the ingestion of alcohol  Criteria A and B   These changes are accompanied by evidence of slurred speech  incoordination  unsteady gait  nystagmus  impairment in attention or memory  or stupor or coma  Criterion C   The symptoms must not be due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another
mental disorder  Criterion D   The resulting picture is similar to what is observed during Benzodiazepine or Barbiturate Intoxication  The levels of incoordination can interfere with driving abilities and with performing usual activities to the point of causing accidents  Evidence of alcohol use can be obtained by smelling alcohol on the individual's breath  eliciting a history from the individual or another observer  and  when needed  having the individual undertake breath  blood  or urine toxicology analyses 291 9 Alcohol-Related Disorder Not Otherwise SpecifiedThe Alcohol-Related Disorder Not Otherwise Specified category is for disorders associated with the use of alcohol that are not classifiable as Alcohol Dependence  Alcohol Abuse  Alcohol Intoxication  Alcohol Withdrawal  Alcohol Intoxication Delirium  Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium  Alcohol-Induced Persisting Dementia  Alcohol-Induced Persisting Amnestic Disorder  Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder  Alcohol-Induced Mood Disorder  Alcohol-Induced Anxiety Disorder  Alcohol-Induced Sexual Dysfunction  or Alcohol-Induced Sleep Disorder 304 20 Cocaine DependenceAlso refer to the text and criteria for Substance Dependence  see p  176   Cocaine has extremely potent euphoric effects  and individuals exposed to it can develop Dependence after using cocaine for very short periods of time  An early sign of Cocaine Dependence is when the individual finds it increasingly difficult to resist using cocaine whenever it is available  Because of its short half-life  there is a need for frequent dosing to maintain a "high " Persons with Cocaine Dependence can spend extremely large amounts of money on the drug within a very short period of time  As a result  the person using the substance may become involved in theft  prostitution  or drug dealing or may request salary advances to obtain funds to purchase the drug  Individuals with Cocaine Dependence often find it necessary to discontinue use for several days to rest or to obtain additional funds  Important responsibilities such as work or child care may be grossly neglected to obtain or use cocaine  Mental or physical complications of chronic use such as paranoid ideation  aggressive behavior  anxiety  depression  and weight loss are common  Regardless of the route of administration  tolerance occurs with repeated use  Withdrawal symptoms  particularly dysphoric mood  can be seen  but are usually transitory and associated with high-dose use

Hallucinogen-Related Disorders 235Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder may produce considerable anxiety and concern and may be more common in suggestible persons  Hallucinogen Dependence and Abuse may co-occur with chronic psychotic conditions  It remains controversial whether the chronic hallucinogen use produces a Psychotic Disorder de novo  triggers psychotic symptoms only in vulnerable persons  or is simply an early and continuing sign of an evolving psychotic process  Hallucinogen Abuse and Dependence also frequently occur in persons with preexisting adolescent Conduct Disorder or adult Antisocial Personality Disorder  LSD intoxication may be confirmed by urine toxicology Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesHallucinogens may be used as part of established religious practices  Within the United States  there are regional differences in their use  Hallucinogen Intoxication usually first occurs in adolescence  and younger users may tend to experience more disruptive emotions  Hallucinogen use and Intoxication appear to be three times more common among males than among females PrevalenceA community survey conducted in the United States in 1991 reported that 8% of the population had used hallucinogens or phencyclidine  PGP  at least one or more times in their lifetime  The cohort with the highest lifetime use was persons ages 26-34 years  among whom 26% had ever tried hallucinogens  However  recent use was most common among those ages 18-25 years  with 2% of this group having used hallucinogens within the last month  A community study conducted in the United States from 1980 to 1985 that used the more narrowly defined DSM-III criteria found that about 0 3% of the adult population had Hallucinogen Abuse at some time in their lives CourseHallucinogen Intoxication may be a brief and isolated event or may occur repeatedly  The intoxication may be prolonged if doses are frequently repeated during an episode  Frequent dosing  however  tends to reduce the intoxicating effects because of the development of tolerance  Depending on the drug and its route of administration  peak effects occur within a few minutes to a few hours  and intoxication ends within a few hours to a few days after dosing ends  The high prevalence of "ever having used" hallucinogens among those ages 26-34 years and the lower prevalence of recent use in that group suggest that many individuals may stop using hallucinogens as they get older  Some individuals who use hallucinogen report "flashbacks" that are not associated with any impairment or distress  On the other hand  flashbacks can cause impairment or distress in some individuals  Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder  see above  Differential DiagnosisFor a general discussion of the differential diagnosis of Substance-Related Disorders  see p  190  Hallucinogen-Induced Disorders may be characterized by symptoms  e g

240 Substance-Related DisordersOther Inhalant-Induced DisordersThe following Inhalant-Induced Disorders are described in other sections of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology  Inhalant Intoxication Delir- ium  p  129  Inhalant-Induced Persisting Dementia  p  152  Inhalant-Induced Psychotic Disorder  p  310   Inhalant-Induced Mood Disorder  p  370   and Inhalant-Induced Anxiety Disorder  p  439  These disorders are diagnosed instead of Inhalant Intoxication only when the symptoms are in excess of those usually associated with Inhalant Intoxication and when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention Additional Information on Inhalant-Related DisordersAssociated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Individuals with Inhalant Intoxication may present with auditory  visual  or tactile hallucinations or other percep- tual disturbances  macropsia  micropsia  illusionary misperceptions  alterations in time perception   Delusions  such as believing one can fly  may develop during periods of Inhalant Intoxication  especially those characterized by marked confusion  in some cases  these delusions may be acted on with resultant injury  Anxiety may also be present  Repeated but episodic intake of inhalants may first be associated with school problems  e g   truancy  poor grades  dropping out of school  as well as family conflict  Use by older adolescents and young adults is often associated with social and work problems  e g   delinquency  unemployment   Most commonly  inhalants are used by adolescents in a group setting  Solitary use tends to be more typical of those with long-term  heavy use  The use of inhalants as the predominant substance among those seeking help for Substance Dependence appears to be rare  but inhalants may be a secondary drug used by individuals with Dependence on other substances  In some individuals  there may be a progression to a stage at which inhalants become the preferred substance Associated laboratory findings  Direct assay for inhalants is rarely used clinically and is generally not part of routine screening for drugs of abuse  Damage to muscles  kidneys  liver  and other organs can result in laboratory tests being indicative of these pathological conditions Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions The odor of paint or solvents may be present on the breath or clothes of individuals who use inhalants  or there may be a residue of the substance on clothing or skin  A "glue sniffer's rash" may be evident around the nose and mouth  and conjunctival irritation may be noted  There may be evidence of trauma due to disinhibited behavior or burns due to the flammable nature of these compounds  Nonspecific respiratory findings include evidence of upper- or lower-airway irritation  including coughing  sinus discharge  dyspnea  rales  or rhonchi  rarely  cyanosis may result from pneumonitis or asphyxia  There may also be headache  generalized weakness  abdominal pain  nausea  and vomiting  Inhalants can cause both central and peripheral nervous system damage 
which may be permanent  Examination of the individual who chronically uses inhalants may reveal a number of neurological deficits  including generalized weakness and peripheral neuropathies  Cerebral atrophy  cerebellar degeneration  and white matter lesions resulting in cranial nerve or pyramidal tract signs have been reported among individuals with heavy use  Recurrent use may lead to the development of hepatitis  which may progress to cirrhosis  or metabolic acidosis consistent with distal renal tubular acidosis  Chronic renal failure  hepatorenal syndrome  and proximal renal tubular acidosis have also been reported  as has bone marrow suppression  Some inhalants  e g   methylene chloride  may be metabolized to carbon monoxide  Death may occur from respiratory or cardiovasculardepression  in particular "sudden sniffing death" may result from acute arrhythmia hypoxia  or electrolyte abnormalities Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesBecause of their low cost and easy availability  inhalants are often the first drugs of experimentation for young people  and there may be a higher incidence among those living in economically depressed areas  Inhalant use may begin by ages 9-12 years  appears to peak in adolescence  and is less common after age 35 years  Males account for 70%-80% of inhalant-related emergency-room visits PrevalenceInhalant Dependence and Abuse appear to occur in only a small proportion of individuals who use inhalants CourseIt can be difficult to match inhalant dose to effect because the different methods of administration and the varying concentrations of inhalants in the products used cause highly variable concentrations in the body  The time course of Inhalant Intoxication is related to the pharmacological characteristics of the specific substance used  but it is typically brief  lasting from a few minutes to an hour  Onset is rapid  peaking within a few minutes after inhaling Younger children diagnosed as having Inhalant Dependence may use inhalants several times a week  often on weekends and after school  Severe dependence in adults may involve varying periods of intoxication throughout each day and occasional periods of heavier use that may last several days  This pattern may persist for years  with recurrent need for treatment  Individuals who use inhalants may have a preferred level or degree of intoxication  and the method of administration typically sniffing from a container or breathing through a rag soaked in the substance  may allow the individual to maintain that level for several hours  Cases have also been reported of the development of Dependence in industrial workers who have long-term occupational exposure and access to inhalants  A worker may begin to use the compound for its psychoactive effects and subsequently develop a pattern of Dependence  Use leading to Dependence may also occur in people who do not have access to other substances  e g   prisoners  isolated military personnel  and adolescents or young adults in isolated rural areas  Inhalant-Related Disorders 241
242 Substance-Related DisordersDifferential DiagnosisFor a general discussion of the differential diagnosis of Substance-Related Disorders  see p  190  Inhalant-Induced Disorders may be characterized by symptoms  e g   depressed mood  that resemble primary mental disorders  e g   Major Depressive Disorder versus Inhalant-Induced Mood Disorder  With Depressive Features  With Onset During Intoxication   See p  193 for a discussion of this differential diagnosis The symptoms of mild to moderate Inhalant Intoxication can be similar to those of Alcohol Intoxication and Sedative  Hypnotic  or Anxiolytic Intoxication  Breath odor or residues on body or clothing may be important differentiating clues  but should not be relied on exclusively  Individuals who chronically use inhalants are likely to use other substances frequently and heavily  further complicating the diagnostic picture  Concomitant use of alcohol may also make the differentiation difficult  History of the drug used and characteristic findings  including odor of solvent or paint residue  may differentiate Inhalant Intoxication from other substance intoxications  additionally  symptoms may subside faster with Inhalant Intoxication than with other substance intoxications  Rapid onset and resolution may also differentiate Inhalant Intoxication from other mental disorders and neurological conditions  Inhalant Intoxication is distinguished from the other Inhalant-Induced Disorders  e g   Inhalant-Induced Mood Disorder  With Onset During Intoxication  because the symptoms in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with Inhalant Intoxication and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention Industrial workers may occasionally be accidentally exposed to volatile chemi- cals and suffer physiological intoxication  The category "Other Substance-Related Disorders" should be used for such toxin exposures 292 9 Inhalant-Related Disorder Not Otherwise SpecifiedThe Inhalant-Related Disorder Not Otherwise Specified category is for disorders associ- ated with the use of inhalants that are not classifiable as Inhalant Dependence  Inhalant Abuse  Inhalant Intoxication  Inhalant Intoxication Delirium  Inhalant-Induced Persisting Dementia  Inhalant-Induced Psychotic Disorder  Inhalant-Induced Mood Disorder  or Inhalant-Induced Anxiety Disorder Nicotine-Related DisordersNicotine Dependence and Withdrawal can develop with use of all forms of tobacco  cigarettes  chewing tobacco  snuff  pipes  and cigars  and with prescription medications  nicotine gum and patch   The relative ability of these products to produce Dependence or to induce Withdrawal is associated with the rapidity characteristic of the route of administration  smoked over oral over transdermal  and the nicotine content of the product This section contains discussions specific to the Nicotine-Related Disorders  Texts and criteria sets have already been provided to define the generic aspects of Substance Dependence  p  176  that apply across all substances  Text specific to Nicotine Dependence is provided below  Nicotine intoxication and nicotine abuse are not
included in DSM-IV  nicotine intoxication rarely occurs and has not been well studied  and nicotine abuse is not likely to be observed in the absence of Dependence  A specific text and criteria set for Nicotine Withdrawal is also provided below  Listed below are the Nicotine-RelatedDisorders Nicotine Use Disorder305 10 Nicotine Dependence  see p  243  Nicotine-Induced Disorder292 0 Nicotine Withdrawal  see p  244 292 9 Nicotine-Related Disorder Not Otherwise Specified  see p  247 Nicotine Use Disorder305 10 Nicotine DependenceAlso refer to the text and criteria for Substance Dependence  see p  176   Some of the generic Dependence criteria do not appear to apply to nicotine  whereas others require further explanation  Tolerance to nicotine is manifested by the absence of nausea  dizziness  and other characteristic symptoms despite using substantial amounts of nicotine or a diminished effect observed with continued use of the same amount of nicotine-containing products  Cessation of nicotine use produces a well-defined with- drawal syndrome that is described below  Many individuals who use nicotine take nicotine to relieve or to avoid withdrawal symptoms when they wake up in the morning or after being in a situation where use is restricted  e g   at work or on an airplane   Individuals who smoke and other individuals who use nicotine are likely to find that they use up their supply of cigarettes or other nicotine-containing products faster than originally intended  Although over 80% of individuals who smoke express a desire to stop smoking and 35% try to stop each year  less than 5% are successful in unaided attempts to quit  Spending a great deal of time in using the substance is best exemplified by chain-smoking  Because nicotine sources are readily and legally available  spending a great deal of time attempting to procure nicotine would be rare  Giving up important social  occupational  or recreational activities can occur when an individual forgoes an activity because it occurs in smoking-restricted areas  Continued use despite knowledge of medical problems related to smoking is a particularly important health problem  e g   an individual who continues to smoke despite having a tobacco-induced general medical condition such as bronchitis or chronic obstructive lung disease  000000000The following specifiers may be applied to a diagnosis of Nicotine Dependence  see p  179 for more details  With Physiological Dependence Without Physiological DependenceNicotine-Related Disorders 243

246 Substance-Related DisordersAssociated physical examination findings and general medical conditions Nicotine Withdrawal may be associated with a dry or productive cough  decreased heart rate  increased appetite or weight gain  and a dampened orthostatic response  The most common signs of Nicotine Dependence are tobacco odor  cough  evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and excessive skin wrinkling  Tobacco stains on the fingers can occur but are rare  Tobacco use can markedly increase the risk of lung  oral  and other cancers  cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions  chronic obstructive and other lung diseases  ulcers  maternal and fetal complications  and other conditions  Although most of these problems appear to be caused by the carcinogens and carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke rather than by nicotine itself  nicotine may increase the risk for cardiovascular events  Those who have never smoked but are chronically exposed to tobacco smoke appear to be at increased risk for conditions such as lung cancer and heart disease Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesThe prevalence of smoking is decreasing in most industrialized nations  but is increasing in the developing areas  In the United States  the prevalence of smoking is slightly higher in males than in females  however  the prevalence of smoking is decreasing more rapidly in males than in females  In other countries  smoking is often much more prevalent among males PrevalenceIn the United States  approximately 45% of the general population have never smoked  The remainder fall into one or more of the following categories  25% are ex-smokers  30% currently smoke cigarettes  4% use pipes or cigars  and 3% use smokeless tobacco  In the United States  the prevalence of smoking has been decreasing approximately 0 7%-1 0% per year  The lifetime prevalence of Nicotine Dependence in the general population is estimated to be 20% In the United States  between 50% and 80% of individuals who currently smoke have Nicotine Dependence  Lifetime prevalence of Nicotine Withdrawal among persons who smoke appears to be about 50% Prospectively  it is estimated that about 50% of those who quit smoking on their own and about 75% of those in treatment programs experience Nicotine Withdrawalwhen they stop smoking CourseSmokingusuallybegins inthe earlyteens  How quicklydependence develops isunclear  Among those who continue to smoke through age 20 years  95% become regular  daily smokers  Of those who successfully quit  less than 25% quit on their first attempt  Most individuals who smoke have 3-4 failures before they stop smoking for good  In the United States  about 45% of those who have ever smoked eventually stop smoking  Withdrawal symptoms can begin within a few hours of cessation  typically peak in 1-4 days  and last for 3-4 weeks  Depressive symptoms postcessation may be associated with a relapse to smoking  Whether other Nicotine Withdrawal symptoms play a major role in relapse to smoking is debatable  Increased hunger and weight gain often persist for at least 6 months  Six months postcessation  50% of individuals who have quit smoking report having had a desire for a cigarette in the last 24 hours 
Familial PatternThe risk for smoking increases threefold if a first-degree biological relative smokes  Twin and adoption studies indicate that genetic factors contribute to the onset and continuation of smoking  with the degree of heritability equivalent to that observed with Alcohol Dependence Differential DiagnosisFor a general discussion of the differential diagnosis of Substance-Related Disorders  see p  190 The symptoms of Nicotine Withdrawal overlap with those of other substance withdrawal syndromes  Caffeine Intoxication  Anxiety  Mood  and Sleep Disor- ders  and m edication-induced akathisia  Admission to smoke-free inpatient units can induce withdrawal symptoms that might mimic  intensify  or disguise other diagnoses  Reduction of symptoms associated with the resumption of smoking or nicotine- replacement therapy confirms the diagnosis Because regular nicotine use does not appear to impair mental functioning  Nicotine Dependence is not readily confused with other Substance-Related Disorders and mental disorders 292 9 Nicotine-Related Disorder Not Otherwise SpecifiedThe Nicotine-Related Disorder Not Otherwise Specified category is for disorders associated with the use of nicotine that are not classifiable as Nicotine Dependence or Nicotine Withdrawal Opioid-Related DisordersThe opioids include natural opioids  e g   morphine   semisynthetics  e g   heroin   and synthetics with morphine-like action  e g   codeine  hydromorphone  methadone  oxycodone  meperidine  fentanyl   Medications such as pentazocine and buprenorphine that have both opiate agonist and antagonist effects are also included in this class because their agonist properties produce similar physiological and behavioral effects  Opioids are prescribed as analgesics  anesthetics  antidiarrheal agents  or cough suppressants  Heroin is one of the most commonly abused drugs of this class and is usually taken by injection  although it can be smoked or "snorted" when very pure heroin is available  Fentanyl is injected  whereas cough suppressants and antidiarrheal agents are taken orally  The other opioids are taken both by injection and orally This section contains discussions specific to the Opioid-Related Disorders  Texts and criteria sets have already been provided for the generic aspects of Substance Dependence  p  176  and Substance Abuse  p  182  that apply across all substances  Texts specific to Opioid Dependence and Abuse are provided below  however  there are no additional specific criteria sets for Opioid Dependence or Opioid Abuse  Specific text and criteriaOpioid-Related Disorders 247

drug-seeking behavior  along with irritability and increased sensitivity to pain  Three or more of the following must be present to make a diagnosis of Opioid Withdrawal  dysphoric mood  nausea or vomiting  muscle aches  lacrimation or rhinorrhea  pupillary dilation  piloerection  or increased sweating  diarrhea  yawning  fever  and insomnia  Criterion B   Piloerection and fever are associated with severe withdrawal and are not often seen in routine clinical practice because individuals with Opioid Dependence usually obtain substances before withdrawal becomes that far advanced  These symp- toms of Opioid Withdrawal must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion C   The symptoms must not be due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder  Criterion D  In most individuals who are dependent on short-acting drugs such as heroin  withdrawal symptoms occur within 6-24 hours after the last dose  Symptoms may take 2-4 days to emerge in the case of longer-acting drugs such as methadone or LAAM  L-alphacetylmethadol   Acute withdrawal symptoms for a short-acting opioid such as heroin usually peak within 1-3 days and gradually subside over a period of 5-7 days  Less acute withdrawal symptoms can last for weeks to months  These more chronic symptoms include anxiety  dysphoria  anhedonia  insomnia  and drug craving Diagnostic criteria for 292 0 Opioid WithdrawalA  Either of the following  1  cessation of  or reduction in  opioid use that has been heavy and prolonged  several weeks or longer  2  administration of an opioid antagonist after a period of opioid useB  Three  or more  of the following  developing within minutes to several days after CriterionA  1  dysphoric mood 2  nausea or vomiting 3  muscle aches 4  lacrimation or rhinorrhea 5  pupillary dilation  piloerection  or sweating 6  diarrhea 7  yawning  8  fever 9  insomniaC  The symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning D  The symptoms are not due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder Opioid-Related Disorders 251
252 Substance-Related DisordersOther Opioid-Induced DisordersThe following Opioid-Induced Disorders are described in other sections of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology  Opioid Intoxication Delirium  p  129   Opioid-Induced Psychotic Disorder  p  310   Opioid-Induced Mood Disorder  p  370   Opioid-Induced Sexual Dysfunction  p  519   and Opioid- Induced Sleep Disorder  p  601   These disorders are diagnosed instead of Opioid Intoxication or Opioid Withdrawal only when the symptoms are in excess of those usually associated with the Opioid Intoxication or Withdrawal syndrome and when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinicalattention Additional Information on Opioid-Related DisordersAssociated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Opioid Dependence is commonly associated with a history of drug-related crimes  e g   possession or distribu- tion of drugs  forgery  burglary  robbery  larceny  or receiving stolen goods   Among health care professionals and individuals who have ready access to controlled sub- stances  there is often a different pattern of illegal activitiesinvolving problems with state licensing boards  professional staffs of hospitals  or other administrative agencies  Divorce  unemployment  or irregular employment are often associated with Opioid Dependence at all socioeconomic levels For many individuals  the effect of taking an opioid for the first time is dysphoric rather than euphoric  and nausea and vomiting may result  Individuals with Opioid Dependence are especially at risk for the development of brief depressive symptoms and for episodes of mild to moderate depression that meet symptomatic and duration criteria for Major Depressive Disorder  These symptoms may represent an Opioid- Induced Mood Disorder  see p  370  or exacerbations of a preexisting primary depressive disorder  Periods of depression are especially common during chronic intoxication or in association with psychosocial stressors that are related to the Opioid Dependence  Insomnia is common  especially during withdrawal  Antisocial Personality Disorder is much more common in individuals with Opioid Dependence than in the general population  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is also seen with increased frequency  A history of Conduct Disorder in childhood or adolescence has been identified as a significant risk factor for Substance-Related Disorders  especially Opioid Dependence Associated laboratory findings  Routine urine toxicology tests are often positive for opioid drugs in individuals with Opioid Dependence  Urine tests remain positive for most opioids for 12-36 hours after administration  Longer-acting opioids  e g   methadone and LAAM  can be identified in urine for several days  Fentanyl is not detected by standard urine tests but can be identified by more specialized procedures  Laboratory evidence of the presence of other substances  e g   cocaine  marijuana  alcohol  amphetamines  benzodiazepines  is common  Hepatitis screening tests are often positive  either for hepatitis antigen  signifying active infection  or hepatitis antibody
 signifying past infection   Mildly elevated liver function tests are common  either as a result of resolving hepatitis or from toxic injury to the liver due to contaminants that have been mixed with the injected opioid  Subtle changes in cortisol secretion patterns and body temperature regulation have been observed for up to 6 months following opioid detoxification Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions Acute and chronic opioid use are associated with a lack of secretions  causing dry mouth and nose  slowing of gastrointestinal activity  and constipation  Visual acuity may be impaired as a result of pupillary constriction  In individuals who use opioids intrave- nously  sclerosed veins  "tracks"  and puncture marks on the lower portions of the upper extremities are common  Veins sometimes become so badly sclerosed that peripheral edema develops and individuals switch to veins in the legs  neck  or groin  When these veins become unusable or otherwise unavailable  individuals often inject directly into their subcutaneous tissue  "skin-popping"   resulting in cellulitis  abscesses  and circu- lar-appearing scars from healed skin lesions  Tetanus is a relatively rare but extremely serious consequence of injecting opioids  Infections may also occur in other organs and include bacterial endocarditis  hepatitis  and human immunodeficiency virus  HIV  infection  Tuberculosis is a particularly serious problem among individuals who use drugs intravenously  especially those dependent on heroin  Infection with the tubercle bacillus is usually asymptomatic and evident only by the presence of a positive tuberculin skin test  However  many cases of active tuberculosis have been found  especially among those who are infected with HIV  These individuals often have a newly acquired infection  but also are likely to experience reactivation of a prior infection due to impaired immune function  Persons who sniff heroin or other opioids  "snorting"  often develop irritation of the nasal mucosa  sometimes accompanied by perforation of the nasal septum  Difficulties in sexual functioning are common  Males often experience erectile dysfunction during intoxication or chronic use  Females commonly have disturbances of reproductive function and irregular menses The incidence ofHIVinfectionishigh among individualswho use intravenousdrugs  a large proportion of whom are individuals with Opioid Dependence  HIV infection rates have been reported to be as high as 60% among persons dependent on heroin in some areas of the United States In addition to infections such as cellulitis  hepatitis  HIV  tuberculosis  and endocar- ditis  Opioid Dependence is associated with a very high death rateâ€”at the level of approximately 10 per 1 000 per year among untreated persons  Death most often results from overdose  accidents  injuries  or other general medical complications  Accidents and injuries due to violence that is associated with buying or selling drugs are common  In some areas  violence accounts for more opioid-related deaths than overdose or HIV infection  Physiological dependence on opioids may occur in about half of the infants born to females with Opioid Dependence  this can produce a severe withdrawal syndrome requiring medical treatment  Although low birth weight is also seen in children of mothers with Opioid Dependence  it is usually not marked and is generally not associated with serious adverse consequences Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesSince the 1920s  in the United States  members of minority groups living in economically deprived areas have been overrepresented among persons with Opioid Dependence Opioid-Related Disorders 253
254 Substance-Related DisordersHowever  in the late 1800s and early 1900s  Opioid Dependence was seen more often among white middle-class individuals  suggesting that differences in use reflect the availability of opioid drugs and other social factors  Medical personnel who have ready access to opioids may have an increased risk for Opioid Abuse and Dependence Increasing age appears to be associated with a decrease in prevalence  This tendency for Dependence to remit generally begins after age 40 years and has been called "maturing out " However  many persons have remained opioid dependent for 50 years or longer  Males are more commonly affected  with the male-to-female ratio typically being 3 or 4 1 PrevalenceA community survey conducted in the United States in 1991 reported that 6% of the population sampled ever used analgesics for nonmedical purposes  2 5%had used them within the past year  and 0 7% has used them in the last month  The survey also showed that 1 3% had used heroin in their lifetime  and 0 2% had used it in the last year  use in the last month was not reported   Because the survey assessed patterns of use rather than diagnoses  it is not known how many of those who used analgesics or heroin had symptoms that met criteria for Dependence or Abuse  A community study conducted in the United States from 1980 to 1985 that used the more narrowly defined DSM-III criteria found that 0 7% of the adult population had Opioid Dependence or Abuse at some time in their lives  Among those with Dependence or Abuse  18%reported use in the last month and 42% reported having had a problem with opioids in the last year CourseOpioid Dependence can begin at any age  but problems associated with opioid use are most commonly first observed in the late teens or early 20s  Once Dependence develops  it is usually continuous over a period of many years  even though brief periods of abstinence are frequent  Relapse following abstinence is common  even after many years of incarceration  One exception to the typical chronic course of Opioid Dependence was observed in service personnel who became dependent on opioids in Vietnam  On their return to the United States  less than 10% of those who had been dependent on opioids relapsed  although they experienced increased rates of Alcohol or Amphetamine Dependence  Few data are available on the course of Opioid Abuse Familial PatternThe family members of individuals with Opioid Dependence are likely to have higher levels of psychopathology  especially an increased incidence of other Substance-Related Disorders and Antisocial Personality Disorder Differential DiagnosisFor a general discussion of the differential diagnosis of Substance-Related Disorders  see p  190  Opioid-Induced Disorders may be characterized by symptoms  e g   depressed mood  that resemble primary mental disorders  e g   Dysthymia versus Opioid- Induced Mood Disorder  With Depressive Features  With Onset During Intoxication  
Phencyclidine-Related Disorders 255See p  193 for a discussion of this differential diagnosis  Opioids are less likely to produce symptoms of mental disturbance than are most other drugs of abuse a n d   in some instances  will even reduce such symptoms  In these cases  mental symptoms or disorders may emerge after opioid use is discontinued A lcohol Intoxication and Sedative  H ypnotic  or A nxiolytic Intoxication can cause a clinical picture that resembles Opioid Intoxication  A diagnosis of Alcohol or Sedative  Hypnotic  or Anxiolytic Intoxication can usually be made based on the absence of pupillary constriction or the lack of a response to a naloxone challenge  In some cases  intoxication may be due both to opioids and to alcohol or other sedatives  In these cases  the naloxone challenge will not reverse all of the sedative effects  The anxiety and restlessness associated with Opioid Withdrawal resemble symptoms seen in Sedative Hypnotic or Anxiolytic Withdrawal However  Opioid Withdrawalis also accompanied by rhinorrhea  lacrimation  and pupillary dilation  which are not seen in sedative-type withdrawal  Dilated pupils are also seen in Hallucinogen Intoxica- tion  Amphetamine Intoxication  and Cocaine Intoxication  However  others signs or symptoms of Opioid Withdrawal such as nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  abdominal cramps  rhinorrhea  or lacrimation are not present  Opioid Intoxication and Opioid Withdrawal are distinguished from the other Opioid-InducedDisorders  e g   Opioid- Induced Mood Disorder  With Onset During Intoxication  because the symptoms in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with Opioid Intoxication or Opioid Withdrawal and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention 292 9 Opioid-Related Disorder Not Otherwise SpecifiedThe Opioid-Related Disorder Not Otherwise Specified category is for disorders associated with the use of opioids that are not classifiable as Opioid Dependence  Opioid Abuse  Opioid Intoxication  Opioid Withdrawal  Opioid Intoxication Delirium  Opioid-Induced Psychotic Disorder  Opioid-Induced Mood Disorder  Opioid-Induced Sexual Dysfunc- tion  or Opioid-Induced Sleep Disorder Phencyclidine or Phencfclidine-LikeJ-Related DisordersThe phencyclidines  or phencyclidine-like  substances include phencyclidine  PCP  Sernylan  and similarly acting compounds such as ketamine  Ketalar  Ketaject  and the thiophene analogue of phencyclidine  TCP  l-[l-2-thienyl-cyclohexyl]piperidine   These substances were first developed as dissociative anesthetics in the 1950s and became street drugs in the 1960s  They can be taken orally or intravenously or can be smoked  Phencyclidine  sold illicitly under a variety of names such as PCP  Hog Tranq  Angel Dust  and PeaCe Pill  is the most commonly abused substance in this class This section contains discussions specific to the Phencyclidine-Related Disorders  Texts and criteria sets have already been provided for the generic aspects of Substance Dependence  p  176  and Substance Abuse  p  182  that apply across all substances  Texts specific to Phencyclidine Dependence and Abuse are provided below  however  there are no additional specific criteria sets for Phencyclidine Dependence or Phency- clidine Abuse  A specific text and criteria set for Phencyclidine Intoxication is also

Sedative-  Hypnotic-  or Anxiolytic-Related Disorders 267Additional Information onSedative-  Hypnotic-  or Anxiolytic-Related DisordersAssociated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Sedative  Hypnotic  or Anxiolytic Dependence and Abuse may often be associated with Dependence on  or Abuse of  other substances  e g   alcohol  cannabis  cocaine  heroin  amphetamines   Sedatives are often used to alleviate the unwanted effects of these other substances  Acute Intoxication can result in accidental injury through falls and automobile accidents  For elderly individuals  even short-term use of these sedating medications at prescribed doses can be associated with an increased risk for cognitive problems and falls  Some data indicate that the disinhibiting effects of these agents can  like alcohol  actually contribute to overly aggressive behavior  with subsequent interpersonal and legal problems  Intense or repeated Sedative  Hypnotic  or Anxiolytic Intoxication may be associated with severe depressions that  although temporary  can be intense enough to lead to suicide attempts and completed suicides  Accidental or deliberate overdoses  similar to those observed for Alcohol Abuse or Dependence or repeated Alcohol Intoxication  can occur  In contrast to their wide margin of safety when used alone  benzodiazepines taken in combination with alcohol appear to be particularly dangerous  and accidental overdoses have been reported  Accidental overdoses have also been reported in individuals who deliberately abuse barbiturates and other nonbenzodiaze- pine sedatives  e g   methaqualone   With repeated use in search of euphoria  tolerance develops to the sedative effects  and a progressively higher dose is used  However  tolerance to brain stem depressant effects develops much more slowly  and as the person takes more substance to achieve euphoria  there may be a sudden onset of respiratory depression and hypotension  which may result in death  Antisocial behavior and Antisocial Personality Disorder are associated with Sedative  Hypnotic  or Anxiolytic Dependence and Abuse  especially when the substances are obtained illegally Associated laboratory findings  Almost all of these substances can be identified through laboratory evaluations of urine or blood  which can quantify the amounts of these agents in the body   Urine tests are likely to remain positive for up to a week or so after the use of long-acting substances  e g   flurazepam  Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions Physical examination is likely to reveal evidence of a mild decrease in most aspects of autonomic nervous system functioning  including a slower pulse  a slightly decreased respiratory rate  and a slight drop in blood pressure  most likely to occur with postural changes   Overdoses of sedatives  hypnotics  and anxiolytics may be associated with a deterioration in vital signs that may signal an impending medical emergency  e g   respiratoryarrestfrombarbiturates  Theremaybeconsequences oftrauma e g  internal bleeding or a subdural hematoma  from accidents that occur while intoxicated  Intravenous use of these substances can result in medical complications related to the use of contaminated needles  e g   hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection  
268 Substance-Related DisordersSpecific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesThere are marked variations in prescription patterns  and availability  of this class of substances in different countries  which may lead to variations in prevalence of Sedative-  Hypnotic-  or Anxiolytic-Related Disorders  Deliberate Intoxication to achieve a "high" is most likely to be observed in teenagers and individuals in their 20s  Withdrawal  Dependence  and Abuse are also seen in individuals in their 40s and older who escalate the dose of prescribed medications  Both acute and chronic toxic effects of these substances  especially effects on cognition  memory  and motor coordination  are likely to increase with age as a consequence of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic age-related changes  Individuals with dementia are more likely to develop Intoxication and impaired physiological functioning at lower doses  Women may be at higher risk for prescription drug abuse of substances of this class PrevalenceIn the United States  up to 90% of individuals hospitalized for medical care or surgery receive orders for sedative  hypnotic  or anxiolytic medications during their hospital stay  and more than 15%of American adults use these medications  usually by prescription  during any 1 year  Most of these individuals take the medication as directed  without evidence of misuse  Among the medications in this class  the benzodiazepines are the most widely used  with perhaps 10% of adults having taken a benzodiazepine for at least 1 month during the prior year  A community survey conducted in the United States in 1991 reported that about 4% of the population sampled had ever used sedatives for nonmedical purposes  approximately 1% had such use in the last year  and 0 4% in the last month  For antianxiety agents  around 6% of the population had ever used them for nonmedical purposes  almost 2% had such use in the last year  and 0 5% in the last month  Because the survey assessed patterns of use rather than diagnoses  it is not known how many of those who used substances from this class had symptoms that met criteria for Dependence or Abuse  A community study conducted in the United States from 1980 to 1985 that used the more narrowly defined DSM-III criteria found that 1 1% of the population surveyed had met criteria for Sedative  Hypnotic  or Anxiolytic Abuse or Dependence at some time in their lives CourseThe more usual course involves young people in their teens or 20s who may escalate their "recreational" use of sedatives  hypnotics  and anxiolytics to the point at which they develop problems that might qualify for a diagnosis of Dependence or Abuse  This pattern may be especially likely among individuals who have other Substance Use Disorders  e g   related to alcohol  opioids  cocaine  amphetamine   An initial pattern of intermittent use at parties can lead to daily use and high levels of tolerance  Once this occurs  an increasing level of interpersonal  work  and legal difficulties  as well as increasingly severe episodes of memory impairment and physiological withdrawal  can be expected to ensue The second and less frequently observed clinical course begins with an individual who originally obtained the medication by prescription from a physician  usually for the treatment of anxiety  insomnia  or somatic complaints  Although the great majority of those who are prescribed a medication from this class do not develop problems  a small

Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic DisordersThe disorders included in this section are all characterized by having psychotic symptoms as the defining feature  Other disorders that may present with psychotic symptoms  but not as defining features  are included elsewhere in the manual  e g  Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type and Substance-Induced Delirium in the "Delirium  Dementia  and Amnestic and Other Cognitive Disorders" section  Major Depressive Disorder  With Psychotic Features  in the "Mood Disorders" section  The term psychotic has historically received a number of different definitions  none of which has achieved universal acceptance  The narrowest definition of psychotic is restricted to delusions or prominent hallucinations  with the hallucinations occurring in the absence of insight into their pathological nature  A slightly less restrictive definition would also include prominent hallucinations that the individual realizes are hallucinatory experiences  Broader still is a definition that also includes other positive symptoms of Schizophrenia  i e   disorganized speech  grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior   Unlike these definitions based on symptoms  the definition used in earlier classifications  e g   DSM-II and ICD-9  was probably far too inclusive and focused on the severity of functional impairment  so that a mental disorder was termed "psychotic" if it resulted in "impairment that grossly interferes with the capacity to meet ordinary demands of life " Finally  the term has been defined conceptually as a loss of ego boundaries or a gross impairment in reality testing  The different disorders in this section emphasize different aspects of the various definitions of psychotic  In Schizophrenia  Schizophreniform Disorder  Schizoaffective Disorder  and Brief Psychotic Disorder  the term psychotic refers to delusions  any prominent hallucinations  disorganized speech  or disorganized or catatonic behavior  In Psychotic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition and in Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder  psychotic refers to delusions or only those hallucinations that are not accompanied by insight  Finally  in Delusional Disorder and Shared Psychotic Disorder  psychotic is equivalent to delusional The following disorders are included in this section Schizophrenia is a disturbance that lasts for at least 6 months and includes at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms  i e   two [or more] of the following  delusions  hallucinations  disorganized speech  grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior  negative symptoms   Definitions for the Schizophrenia subtypes  Paranoid  Disorganized  Cata- tonic  Undifferentiated  and Residual  are also included in this section Schizophreniform Disorder is characterized by a symptomatic presentation that 273
274 Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disordersis equivalent to Schizophrenia except for its duration  i e   the disturbance lasts from 1 to 6 months  and the absence of a requirement that there be a decline in functioning  Schizoaffective Disorder is a disturbance in which a mood episode and theactive-phase symptoms of Schizophrenia occur together and were preceded or are followed by at least 2 weeks of delusions or hallucinations without prominent mood symptoms Delusional Disorder is characterized by at least 1 month of nonbizarre delusions without other active-phase symptoms of Schizophrenia Brief Psychotic Disorder is a psychotic disturbance that lasts more than 1 day and remits by 1 month Shared Psychotic Disorder is a disturbance that develops in an individual who is influenced by someone else who has an established delusion with similar content In Psychotic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  the psychotic symptoms are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition In Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder  the psychotic symptoms are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a drug of abuse  a medication  or toxin exposure Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified is included for classifying psychotic presentations that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific Psychotic Disorders defined in this section or psychotic symptomatology about which there is inadequate or contradictory information SchizophreniaThe essential features of Schizophrenia are a mixture of characteristic signs and symptoms  both positive and negative  that have been present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period  or for a shorter time if successfully treated   with some signs of the disorder persisting for at least 6 months  Criteria A and C   These signs and symptoms are associated with marked social or occupational dysfunction  Criterion B   The disturbance is not better accounted for by Schizoaffective Disorder or a Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition  CriteriaD and E   In individualswith a previous diagnosis of Autistic Disorder  or another Pervasive Developmental Disorder   the additional diagnosis of Schizophrenia is warranted only if prominent delusions or hallucinations are present for at least a month  Criterion F   The characteristicsymptoms of Schizophrenia involve a range of cognitive and emotional dysfunctions that include perception  inferential thinking  language and communication  behavioral monitoring  affect  fluency and productivity of thought and speech  hedonic capacity  volition and drive  and attention  No single symptom is pathognomonic of Schizophrenia  the diagnosis involves the recognition of a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with impaired occupational or social functioning Characteristic symptoms  Criterion A  may be conceptualized as falling into two broad categoriesâ€”positive and negative  The positive symptoms appear to reflect an excess or distortion of normal functions  whereas the negative symptoms appear to reflect a diminution or loss of normal functions  The positive symptoms  Criteria A1-A4  include distortions or exaggerations of inferential thinking  delusions   perception
 hallucinations   language and communication  disorganized speech   and behavioral monitoring  grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior   These positive symptoms may comprise two distinct dimensions  which may in turn be related to different underlying neural mechanisms and clinical correlations  the "psychotic dimension" includes delu- sions and hallucinations  whereas the "disorganization dimension" includes disorga- nized speech and behavior  Negative symptoms  Criterion A5  include restrictions in the range and intensity of emotional expression  affective flattening   in the fluency and productivity of thought and speech  alogia   and in the initiation of goal-directed behavior  avolition  Delusions  Criterion Al  are erroneous beliefs that usually involve a misinterpreta- tion of perceptions or experiences  Their content may include a variety of themes  e g   persecutory  referential  somatic  religious  or grandiose   Persecutory delusions are most common  the person believes he or she is being tormented  followed  tricked  spied on  or subjected to ridicule  Referential delusions are also common  the person believes that certain gestures  comments  passages from books  newspapers  song lyrics  or other environmental cues are specifically directed at him or her  The distinction between a delusion and a strongly held idea is sometimes difficult to make and depends on the degree of conviction with which the belief is held despite clear contradictory evidence Although bizarre delusions are considered to be especially characteristic of Schizo- phrenia  "bizarreness" may be difficult to judge  especially across different cultures  Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible and not understandable and do not derive from ordinary life experiences  An example of a bizarre delusion is a person's belief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and has replaced them with someone else's organs without leaving any wounds or scars  An example of a nonbizarre delusion is a person's false belief that he or she is under surveillance by the police  Delusions that express a loss of control over mind or body  i e   those included among Schneider's list of "first-rank symptoms"  are generally considered to be bizarre  these include a person's belief that his or her thoughts have been taken away by some outside force  "thought withdrawal"   that alien thoughts have been put into his or her mind  "thought insertion"   or that his or her body or actions are being acted on or manipulated by some outside force  "delusions of control"   If the delusions are judged to be bizarre  only this single symptom is needed to satisfy Criterion A for Schizophrenia Hallucinations  Criterion A2  may occur in any sensory modality  e g   auditory  visual  olfactory  gustatory  and tactile   but auditory hallucinations are by far the most common and characteristic of Schizophrenia  Auditory hallucinations are usually expe- rienced as voices  whether familiar or unfamiliar  that are perceived as distinct from the person's own thoughts  The content may be quite variable  although pejorative or threatening voices are especially common  Certain types of auditory hallucinations  i e   two or more voices conversing with one another or voices maintaining a running commentary on the person's thoughts or behavior  have been considered to be particularly characteristic of Schizophrenia and were included among Schneider's list of first-rank symptoms  If these types of hallucinations are present  then only this single symptom is needed to satisfy Criterion A  The hallucinations must occur in the context of a clear sensorium  those that occur while falling asleep  hypnagogic  or waking up  hypnopompic  are considered to be within the range of normal experience  Isolated experiences of hearing one's name called or experiences that lack the quality of an external percept  e g   a humming in one's head  are also not considered to be hallucinations characteristic of Schizophrenia  Hallucinations may also be a normal part of religious experience in certain cultural contexts Schizophrenia 275
276 Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic DisordersDisorganized thinking  "formal thought disorder " "loosening of associations"  has been argued by some  Bleuler  in particular  to be the single most important feature of Schizophrenia  Because of the difficulty inherent in developing an objective definition of "thought disorder " and because in a clinical setting inferences about thought are based primarily on the individual's speech  the concept of disorganized speech  Criterion A3  has been emphasized in the definition for Schizophrenia used in this manual  The speech of individuals with Schizophrenia may be disorganized in a variety of ways  The person may "slip off the track" from one topic to another  "derailment" or "loose associations"   answers to questions may be obliquely related or completely unrelated  "tangentiality"   and  rarely  speech may be so severely disorganized that it is nearly incomprehensible and resembles receptive aphasia in its linguistic disorganization  "incoherence" or "word salad"   Because mildly disorganized speech is common and nonspecific  the symptom must be severe enough to substantially impair effective communication  Less severe disorganized thinking or speech may occur during the prodromal and residual periods of Schizophrenia  see CriterionC  Grossly disorganized behavior  Criterion A4  may manifest itself in a variety of ways  ranging from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation  Problems may be noted in any form of goal-directed behavior  leading to difficulties in performing activities of daily living such as organizing meals or maintaining hygiene  The person may appear markedly disheveled  may dress in an unusual manner  e g   wearing multiple overcoats  scarves  and gloves on a hot day   or may display clearly inappropriate sexual behavior  e g   public masturbation  or unpredictable and untriggered agitation  e g   shouting or swearing   Care should be taken not to apply this criterion too broadly  Grossly disorganized behavior must be distinguished from behavior that is merely aimless or generally unpurposeful and from organized behavior that is motivated by delusional beliefs  Similarly  a few instances of restless  angry  or agitated behavior should not be considered to be evidence of Schizophrenia  especially if the motivation is understandable Catatonic motor behaviors  Criterion A4  include a marked decrease in reactivity to the environment  sometimes reaching an extreme degree of complete unawareness  catatonic stupor   maintaining a rigid posture and resisting efforts to be moved  catatonic rigidity   active resistance to instructions or attempts to be moved  catatonic negativism  the assumption of inappropriate or bizarre postures  catatonic posturing   or purposeless and unstimulated excessive motor activity  catatonic excitement   Although catatonia has historically been associated with Schizophrenia  the clinician should keep in mind that catatonic symptoms are nonspecific and may occur in other mental disorders  see Mood Disorders With Catatonic Features  p  382   in general medical conditions  see Catatonic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  p  169   and Medication-Induced Movement Disorders  see Neuroleptic-Induced Parkinsonism  p  736  The negative symptoms of Schizophrenia  Criterion A5  account for a substantial degree of the morbidity associated with the disorder  Three negative symptomsâ€” affective flattening  alogia  and avolitionâ€”are included in the definition of Schizophrenia  other negative symptoms  e g   anhedonia  are noted in the "Associated Features and Disorders" section below  Affective flattening is especially common and is characterized by the person's face appearing immobile and unresponsive  with poor eye contact and reduced body language  Although a person with affective flattening may smile and warm up occasionally  his or her range of emotional expressiveness is clearly diminished most of the time  It may be useful to observe the person interacting with peers to determine whether affective flattening is sufficiently persistent to meet the criterion  Alogia  poverty of speech  is manifested by brief  laconic  empty replies  The individual with alogia
appears to have a diminution of thoughts that is reflected in decreased fluency and productivity of speech  This must be differentiated from an unwillingness to speak  a clinical judgment that may require observation over time and in a variety of situations  Avolition is characterized by an inability to initiate and persist in goal-directed activities  The person may sit for long periods of time and show little interest in participating in work or social activities Although quite ubiquitous in Schizophrenia  negative symptoms are difficult to evaluate because they occur on a continuum with normality  are nonspecific  and may be due to a variety of other factors  e g   as a consequence of positive symptoms  medication side effects  a Mood Disorder  environmental understimulation  or demoral- ization   Social isolation or impoverished speech may not be best conceived of as negative symptoms if they occur as a consequence of a positive symptom  e g   a paranoid delusion or a prominent hallucination   For example  the behavior of an individual who has the delusional belief that he will be in danger if he leaves his room or talks to anyone may mimic alogia and avolition  Neuroleptic medications often produce extrapyramidalside effects that closely resemble affective flatteningor avolition  The distinction between true negative symptoms and medication side effects depends on clinical judgment concerning the severity of negative symptoms  the nature and type of neuroleptic medication  the effects of dosage adjustment  and the effects of anticho- linergic medications  The difficult distinction between negative symptoms and depressive symptoms may be informed by the other accompanying symptoms that are present and the fact that individuals with symptoms of depression typically experience an intense painful affect  whereas those with Schizophrenia have a diminution or emptiness of affect  Finally  chronic environmental understimulation or demoralization may result in learned apathy and avolition  In establishing the presence of negative symptoms  perhaps the best test is their persistence for a considerable period of time despite efforts directed at resolving each of the potential causes described above  It has been suggested that enduring negative symptoms be referred to as "deficit" symptoms Criterion A for Schizophrenia requires that at least two of the five items be present concurrently for much of at least 1 month  However  if delusions are bizarre or hallucinations involve "voices commenting" or "voices conversing " then the presence of only one item is required  The presence of this relatively severe constellation of signs and symptoms is referred to as the "active phase " In those situations in which the active-phase symptoms remit within a month in response to treatment  Criterion A can still be considered to have been met if the clinician judges that the symptoms would have persisted for a month in the absence of effective treatment  In children  evaluation of the characteristic symptoms should include due consideration of the presence of other disorders or developmental difficulties  For example  the disorganized speech in a child with a Communication Disorder should not count toward a diagnosis of Schizophrenia unless the degree of disorganization is significantly greater than would be expected on the basis of the Communication Disorder alone Schizophrenia involves dysfunction in one or more major areas of functioning  e g   interpersonal relations  work or education  or self-care   Criterion B   Typically  func- tioning is clearly below that which had been achieved before the onset of symptoms  If the disturbance begins in childhood or adolescence  however  there may be a failure to achieve what would have been expected for the individual rather than a deterioration in functioning  Comparing the individual with unaffected siblings may be helpful in making this determination  Educational progress is frequently disrupted  and the individual may be unable to finish school  Many individuals are unable to hold a job forSchizophrenia 277

Schizophrenia  these individuals are more likely to develop cigarette-related pathology  e g   emphysema and other pulmonary and cardiac problems  Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesClinicians assessing the symptoms of Schizophrenia in socioeconomic or cultural situations that are different from their own must take cultural differences into account  Ideas that may appear to be delusional in one culture  e g   sorcery and witchcraft  may be commonly held in another  In some cultures  visual or auditory hallucinationswith a religious content may be a normal part of religious experience  e g   seeing the Virgin Mary or hearing God's voice   In addition  the assessment of disorganized speech may be made difficult by linguistic variation in narrative styles across cultures that affects the logical form of verbal presentation  The assessment of affect requires sensitivity to differences in styles of emotional expression  eye contact  and body language  which vary across cultures  If the assessment is conducted in a language that is different from the individual's primary language  care must be taken to ensure that alogia is not related to linguisticbarriers  Because the culturalmeaning of self-initiated  goal-directed activity can be expected to vary across diverse settings  disturbances of volition must also be carefully assessed  There is some evidence that clinicians may have a tendency to overdiagnose Schizophrenia  instead of Bipolar Disorder  in some ethnic groups  Cultural differences have been noted in the presentation  course  and outcome of Schizophrenia  Catatonic behavior has been reported as relatively uncommon among individuals with Schizophrenia in the United States but is more common in non-Western countries  Individuals with Schizophrenia in developing nations tend to have a more acute course and a better outcome than do individuals in industrialized nations The onset of Schizophrenia typically occurs between the late teens and the mid-30s  with onset prior to adolescence rare  although cases with age at onset of 5 or 6 years have been reported   The essential features of the condition are the same in children  but it may be particularlydifficult to make the diagnosis in this age group  In children  delusions and hallucinations may be less elaborated than those observed in adults  and visual hallucinations may be more common  Disorganized speech is observed in a number of disorders with childhood onset  e g   Communication Disorders  Pervasive Developmental Disorders   as is disorganized behavior  e g   Attention-Deficit/Hyperac- tivity Disorder  Stereotypic Movement Disorder   These symptoms should not be attributed to Schizophrenia without due consideration of these more common disorders of childhood  Schizophrenia can also begin later in life  e g   after age 45 years   Late-onset cases tend to be similar to earlier-onset Schizophrenia  except for a higher ratio of women  a better occupational history  and a greater frequency of having been married  The clinical presentation is more likely to include paranoid delusions and hallucinations  and less likely to include disorganized and negative symptoms  The course is usually chronic  although individuals are often quite responsive to antipsychotic medications in lower doses  Among those with the oldest age at onset  i e   over age 60 years   sensory deficits  e g   hearing loss  apparently occur more commonly than in the general adult population  Their specific role in pathogenesis remains unknown There are gender differences in the presentation and course of Schizophrenia  Women are more likely to have a later onset  more prominent mood symptoms  and a better prognosis  Although it has long been held that males and females are affected in roughly equal numbers  estimates of sex ratio are confounded by issues of ascertainmentSchizophrenia 281
282 Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disordersand definition  Hospital-based studies suggest a higher rate of Schizophrenia in males  whereas community-based surveys have mostly suggested an equal sex ratio  Broader definitions of Schizophrenia with respect to the boundary with Mood Disorders will yield a higher female-to-male ratio than the relatively narrow construct of Schizophrenia used in this manual PrevalenceThere is variabilityin the reported prevalence of Schizophrenia because different studies haveused different methods ofascertainment e g  ruralversusurban communityversus clinic or hospital  and different definitions of Schizophrenia  narrow versus broad  criterion-based versus clinical   Estimates of prevalence have ranged from 0 2% to 2 0% across many large studies  Prevalence rates are similar throughout the world  but pockets of high prevalence have been reported in some specific areas  Taking all these sources of information into account  the lifetime prevalence of Schizophrenia is usually estimated to be between 0 5% and 1%  Because Schizophrenia tends to be chronic  incidence rate are considerably lower than prevalence rates and are estimated to be approximately 1 per 10 000 per year CourseThe median age at onset for the first psychotic episode of Schizophrenia is in the early to mid-20s for men and in the late 20s for women  The onset may be abrupt or insidious  but the majority of individuals display some type of prodromal phase manifested by the slow and gradual development of a variety of signs and symptoms  e g   social withdrawal  loss of interest in school or work  deterioration in hygiene and grooming  unusual behavior  outbursts of anger   Family members may find this behavior difficult to interpret and assume that the person is "going through a phase " Eventually  however  the appearance of some active-phase symptom marks the disturbance as Schizophrenia  The age at onset may have both pathophysiological and prognostic significance  Individuals with an early age at onset are more often male and have a poorer premorbid adjustment  lower educational achievement  more evidence of structural brain abnor- malities  more prominent negative signs and symptoms  more evidence of cognitive impairment as assessed with neuropsychological testing  and a worse outcome  Con- versely  individuals with a later onset are more often female  have less evidence of structural brain abnormalities or cognitive impairment  and display a better outcome Most studies of course and outcome in Schizophrenia suggest that the course may be variable  with some individuals displaying exacerbations and remissions  whereas others remain chronically ill  Because of variability in definition and ascertainment  an accurate summary of the long-term outcome of Schizophrenia is not possible  Complete remission  i e   a return to full premorbid functioning  is probably not common in this disorder  Of those who remain ill  some appear to have a relatively stable course  whereas others show a progressive worsening associated with severe disability  Early in the illness  negative symptoms may be prominent  appearing primarily as prodromal features  Subsequently  positive symptoms appear  Because these positive symptoms are partic- ularly responsive to treatment  they typically diminish  but in many individuals  negative symptoms persist between episodes of positive symptoms  There is some suggestion that negative symptoms may become steadily more prominent in some individuals during
the course of the illness  Numerous studies have indicated a group of factors that are associated with a better prognosis  These include good premorbid adjustment  acute onset  later age at onset  being female  precipitating events  associated mood disturbance  brief duration of active-phase symptoms  good interepisode functioning  minimal residual symptoms  absence of structural brain abnormalities  normal neurological functioning  a family history of Mood Disorder  and no family history of Schizophrenia Familial PatternThe first-degree biological relatives of individuals with Schizophrenia have a risk for Schizophrenia that is about 10 times greater than that of the general population  Concordance rates for Schizophrenia are higher in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins  Adoption studies have shown that biological relatives of individuals with Schizophrenia have a substantially increased risk for Schizophrenia  whereas adoptive relatives have no increased risk  Although much evidence suggests the importance of genetic factors in the etiology of Schizophrenia  the existence of a substantial discordance rate in monozygotic twins also indicates the importance of environmental factors Differential DiagnosisA wide variety of general medical conditions can present with psychotic symptoms Psychotic Disorder Due to a General MedicalCondition  delirium  or dementiais diagnosed when there is evidence from the history  physical examination  or laboratory tests that indicates that the delusions or hallucinations are the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition  e g   Cushing's syndrome  brain tumor   see p  306   Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder  Substance-Induced Delirium and Substance-Induced Persisting Dementia are distinguished from Schizophrenia by the fact that a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the delusions or hallucinations  see p  310   Man different types of Substance-Related Disorders may produce symptoms similar to those of Schizophrenia  e g   sustained amphetamine or cocaine use may produce delusions or hallucinations  phencyclidine use may produce a mixture of positive and negative symptoms   Based on a variety of features that characterize the course of Schizophrenia and Substance-Related Disorders  the clinician must determine whether the psychotic symptoms have been initiated and maintained by the substance use  Ideally  the clinician should attempt to observe the individual during a sustained period  e g   4 weeks  of abstinence  However  because such prolonged periods of abstinence are often difficult to achieve  the clinician may need to consider other evidence  such as whether the psychotic symptoms appear to be exacerbated by the substance and to diminish when it has been discontinued  the relative severity of psychotic symptoms in relation to the amount and duration of substance use  and knowledge of the characteristic symptoms produced by a particular substance  e g   amphetamines typically produce delusions and stereotypies  but not affective blunting or prominent negative symptoms  Distinguishing Schizophrenia from Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features an SchizoaffectiveDisorder is made difficult by the fact that mood disturbance is common during the prodromal  active  and residual phases of Schizophrenia  If psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during periods of mood disturbance  the diagnosis is Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features  In Schizoaffective Disorder  there must be a moodSchizophrenia 283

295 70 Schizoaffective DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Schizoaffective Disorder is an uninterrupted period of illness during which  at some time  there is a Major Depressive  Manic  or Mixed Episode concurrent with symptoms that meet Criterion A for Schizophrenia  Criterion A   In addition  during the same period of illness  there have been delusions or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms  Criterion B   Finally  the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total duration of the illness  Criterion C   The symptoms must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   cocaine  or a general medical condition  e g   hyperthyroidism or temporal lobe epilepsy   CriterionD   To meet criteria for Schizoaffective Disorder  the essential features must occur within a single uninterrupted period of illness  The phrase "period of illness" as used here refers to a time period during which the individual continues to display active or residual symptoms of psychotic illness  For some individuals  this period of illness may last for years or even decades  A period of illness is considered to have ended when the individual has completely recovered for a significant interval of time and no longer demonstrates any significant symptoms of the disorder The phase of the illness with concurrent mood and psychotic symptoms is characterized by the full criteria being met for both the active phase of Schizophrenia  i e   Criterion A   see p  274  and for a Major Depressive Episode  p  320   a Mani Episode  p  328   or a Mixed Episode  p  333   The duration of the Major Depressiv Episode must be at least 2 weeks  the duration of the Manic or Mixed Episode must be at least 1 week  Because the psychotic symptoms must have a total duration of at least 1 month to meet Criterion A for Schizophrenia  the minimum duration of a Schizoaffective episode is also 1 month  An essential feature of a Major Depressive Episode is the presence of either depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure  Because loss of interest or pleasure is so common in nonaffective Psychotic Disorders  to meet Criterion A for Schizoaffective Disorder the Major Depressive Episode must include pervasive depressed mood  i e   the presence of markedly diminished interest or pleasure is not sufficient   The phase of the illness with psychotic symptoms alone is characterized by delusions or hallucinationsthat last at least 2 weeks  Although some mood symptoms
295 70 Schizoaffective Disorder 293may be present during this phase  they are not prominent  This determination can be difficult and may require longitudinal observation and multiple sources of information  The symptoms of Schizoaffective Disorder may occur in a variety of temporal patterns  The following is a typical pattern  An individual may have pronounced auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions for 2 months before the onset of a prominent Major Depressive Episode  The psychotic symptoms and the full Major Depressive Episode are then present for 3 months  Then  the person recovers completely from the Major Depressive Episode  but the psychotic symptoms persist for another month before theytoo disappear Duringthisperiod ofillness the individual'ssymptomsconcurrently met criteria for a Major Depressive Episode and Criterion A for Schizophrenia  and  during this same period of illness  auditory hallucinations and delusions were present both before and after the depressive phase  The total period of illness lasted for about 6 months  with psychotic symptoms alone present during the initial 2 months  both depressive and psychotic symptoms present during the next 3 months  and psychotic symptoms alone present during the last month  In this instance  the duration of the depressive episode was not brief relative to the total duration of the psychotic disturbance  and thus the presentation qualifies for a diagnosis of SchizoaffectiveDisorder Criterion C for Schizoaffective Disorder specifies that mood symptoms that meetcriteria for a mood episode must be present for a substantial portion of the entire period of illness  If the mood symptoms are present for only a relatively brief period of time  the diagnosis is Schizophrenia  not Schizoaffective Disorder  In evaluating this criterion  the clinician should determine the proportion of time during the continuous period of psychotic illness  i e   both active and residual symptoms  in which there were significant mood symptoms accompanying the psychotic symptoms  The operationalization of what is meant by "a substantial portion of time" requires clinical judgment  For example  an individual with a 4-year history of active and residual symptoms of Schizophrenia develops a superimposed Major Depressive Episode that lasts for 5 weeks during which the psychotic symptoms persist  This presentation would not meet the criterion for "a substantial portion of the total duration" because the symptoms that meet criteria for a mood episode occurred for only 5 weeks out of a total of 4 years of disturbance  The diagnosis in this example remains Schizophrenia with the additional diagnosis of Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified to indicate the superimposed Major Depressive Episode SubtypesTwo subtypes of Schizoaffective Disorder may be noted based on the mood component of the disorder Bipolar Type  This subtype applies if a Manic Episode or Mixed Episode is part of the presentation  Major Depressive Episodes may also occur Depressive Type  This subtype applies if only Major Depressive Episodes are part of the presentation Associated Features and DisordersThere may be poor occupational functioning  a restricted range of social contact  difficulties with self-care  and increased risk of suicide associated with Schizoaffective Disorder  Residual and negative symptoms are usually less severe and less chronic than
294 Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disordersthose seen in Schizophrenia  Individuals with Schizoaffective Disorder may be at increased risk for later developing episodes of pure Mood Disorder  e g   Major Depressive or Bipolar Disorder  or of Schizophrenia or Schizophreniform Disorder  There may be associated Alcohol and other Substance-RelatedDisorders  Limitedclinical evidence suggests that Schizoaffective Disorder may be preceded by Schizoid  Schizotypal  Borderline  or Paranoid Personality Disorder Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesFor additional discussion of culture  age  and gender factors relevant to evaluating psychotic symptoms  see the text for Schizophrenia  p  281  and for a discussion of such factors relevant to diagnosing Mood Disorders  see p  341 and p  352  Schizoaffective Disorder  Bipolar Type  may be more common in young adults  whereas Schizoaffective Disorder  Depressive Type  may be more common in older adults  Compared with Schizophrenia  Schizoaffective Disorder probably occurs more often in women PrevalenceDetailed information is lacking  but Schizoaffective Disorder appears to be less common than Schizophrenia CourseThe typical age at onset of Schizoaffective Disorder is probably in early adulthood  although onset can occur anywhere from adolescence to late in life  The prognosis for Schizoaffective Disorder is somewhat better than the prognosis for Schizophrenia  but considerably worse than the prognosis for Mood Disorders  Substantial occupational and social dysfunction are not uncommon  The outcome for Schizoaffective Disorder  Bipolar Type  may be better than that for Schizoaffective Disorder  Depressive Type Familial PatternThere is substantial evidence that there is an increased risk for Schizophrenia in first-degree biological relatives of individuals with Schizoaffective Disorder  Most studies also show that relatives of individuals with Schizoaffective Disorder are at increased risk for Mood Disorders Differential DiagnosisGeneral medical conditions and substance use can present with a combination of psychotic and mood symptoms  Psychotic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  a delirium  or a dementia is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history  physical examination  or laboratory tests indicating that the symptoms are the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition  see p 306   Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder and Substance-Induced Delirium are dis- tinguished from Schizoaffective Disorder by the fact that a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms  see p  310  Distinguishing Schizoaffective Disorder from Schizophrenia and from Mood Disorder
295 70 Schizoaffective Disorder 295With Psychotic Features is often difficult  In Schizoaffective Disorder  there must be a mood episode that is concurrent with the active-phase symptoms of Schizophrenia  mood symptoms must be present for a substantial portion of the total duration of the disturbance  and delusions or hallucinations must be present for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms  In contrast  mood symptoms in Schizophrenia either have a duration that is brief relative to the total duration of the disturbance  occur only during the prodromal or residual phases  or do not meet full criteria for a mood episode  If psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during periods of mood disturbance  the diagnosis is Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features  In Schizoaffective Disorder  symptoms should not be counted toward a mood episode if they are clearly the result of symptoms of Schizophrenia  e g   difficulty sleeping because of disturbing auditory hallucinations  weight loss because food is considered poisoned  difficulty concentrating because of psychotic disorganization   Loss of interest or pleasure is common in nonaffective Psychotic Disorders  therefore  to meet Criterion A for Schizoaffective Disorder  the Major Depressive Episode must include pervasive depressed mood Because the relative proportion of mood to psychotic symptoms may change over the course of the disturbance  the appropriate diagnosis for an individual episode of illness may change from Schizoaffective Disorder to Schizophrenia  e g   a diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder for a severe and prominent Major Depressive Episode lasting 3 months during the first 6 months of a chronic psychotic illness would be changed to Schizophrenia if active psychotic or prominent residual symptoms persist over several years without a recurrence of another mood episode   The diagnosis may also change for different episodes of illness separated by a period of recovery  For example  an individual may have an episode of psychotic symptoms that meet Criterion A for Schizophrenia during a Major Depressive Episode  recover fully from this episode  and then later develop 6 weeks of delusions and hallucinations without prominent mood symptoms  The diagnosis in this instance would not be Schizoaffective Disorder because the period of delusions and hallucinations was not continuous with the initial period of disturbance  Instead  the appropriate diagnoses for the first episode would be Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features  In Full Remission  and Schizophreniform Disorder  Provisional  for the current episode Mood disturbances  especially depression  commonly develop during the course of Delusional Disorder  However  such presentations do not meet criteria for Schizoaffec- tive Disorder because the psychotic symptoms in Delusional Disorder are restricted to nonbizarre delusions and therefore do not meet CriterionA for Schizoaffective Disorder If there is insufficient information concerning the relationship between psychotic and mood symptoms  Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified may be the most appropriate diagnosis Diagnostic criteria for 295 70 Schizoaffective DisorderA  An uninterrupted period of illness during which  at some time  there is either a Major Depressive Episode  a Manic Episode  or a Mixed Episode concurrent with symptoms that meet Criterion A for Schizophrenia Note  The Major Depressive Episode must include Criterion Al  depressedmood  continued

297 1 Delusional DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Delusional Disorder is the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions that persist for at least 1 month  Criterion A   A diagnosis of Delusional Disorder is not given if the individual has ever had a symptom presentation that met Criterion A for Schizophrenia  Criterion B   Auditory or visual hallucinations  if present  are not prominent  Tactile or olfactory hallucinations may be present  and prominent  if they are related to the delusional theme  e g   the sensation of being infested with insects associated with delusions of infestation  or the perception that one emits a foul odor from a body orifice associated with delusions of reference   Apart from the direct impact of the delusions  psychosocial functioning is not markedly impaired  and behavior is neither obviously odd nor bizarre  Criterion C   If mood episodes occur concurrently with the delusions  the total duration of these mood episodes is relativelybrief compared to the total duration of the delusional periods  Criterion D   The delusions are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   cocaine  or a general medical condition  e g   Alzheimer's disease  systemic lupus erythematosus   CriterionE  Although the determination of whether delusions are bizarre is considered to be especially important in distinguishing between Delusional Disorder and Schizophrenia  "bizarreness" may be difficult to judge  especially across different cultures  Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible  not understandable  and not derived from ordinary life experiences  e g   an individual's belief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and replaced them with someone else's organs without leaving any
wounds or scars   In contrast  nonbizarre delusions involve situations that can conceiv- ably occur in real life  e g   being followed  poisoned  infected  loved at a distance  or deceived by one's spouse or lover  Psychosocial functioning is variable  Some individuals may appear to be relatively unimpaired in their interpersonal and occupational roles  In others  the impairment may be substantial and include low or absent occupational functioning and social isolation  When poor psychosocial functioning is present in Delusional Disorder  it arises directly from the delusional beliefs themselves  For example  an individual who is convinced that he will be murdered by "Mafia hit men" may quit his job and refuse to leave his house except late at night and only when dressed in clothes quite different from his normal attire  Allof this behavior is an understandable attempt to prevent being identified and killed by his presumed assassins  In contrast  poor functioning in Schizophrenia may be due to both positive and negative symptoms  particularly avolition   Similarly  a common characteristic of individuals with Delusional Disorder is the apparent normality of their behavior and appearance when their delusional ideas are not being discussed or acted on  In general  social and marital functioning are more likely to be impaired than intellectual and occupational functioning SubtypesThe type of Delusional Disorder may be specified based on the predominant delusional theme ErotomanicType  This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is that another person is in love with the individual  The delusion often concerns idealized romantic love and spiritual union rather than sexual attraction  The person about whom this conviction is held is usually of higher status  e g   a famous person or a superior at work   but can be a complete stranger  Efforts to contact the object of the delusion  through telephone calls  letters  gifts  visits  and even surveillance and stalking  are common  although occasionally the person keeps the delusion secret  Most individuals with this subtype in clinical samples are female  most individuals with this subtype in forensic samples are male  Some individuals with this subtype  particularlymales  come into conflict with the law in their efforts to pursue the object of their delusion or in a misguided effort to "rescue" him or her from some imagined danger Grandiose Type  This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is the conviction of having some great  but unrecognized  talent or insight or having made some important discovery  Less commonly  the individual may have the delusion of having a special relationship with a prominent person  e g   an adviser to the President  or being a prominent person  in which case the actual person may be regarded as an impostor   Grandiose delusions may have a religious content  e g   the person believes that he or she has a special message from a deity  Jealous Type  This subtype applies when the central theme of the person's delusion is that his or her spouse or lover is unfaithful  This belief is arrived at without due cause and is based on incorrect inferences supported by small bits of "evidence"  e g   disarrayed clothing or spots on the sheets   which are collected and used to justify the delusion  The individualwith the delusion usually confronts the spouse or lover and attempts to intervene in the imagined infidelity297 1 Delusional Disorder 297
298Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders e g   restricting the spouse's autonomy  secretly following the spouse  investigat- ing the imagined lover  attacking the spouse  PersecutoryType  This subtype applies when the central theme ofthe delusion involves the person's belief that he or she is being conspired against  cheated  spied on  followed  poisoned or drugged  maliciously maligned  harassed  or obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals  Small slights may be exaggerated and become the focus of a delusional system  The focus of the delusion is often on some injustice that must be remedied by legal action  "querulous paranoia"   and the affected person may engage in repeated attempts to obtain satisfaction by appeal to the courts and other government agencies  Individuals with persecutory delusions are often resentful and angry and may resort to violence against those they believe are hurting them Somatic Type  This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion involves bodily functions or sensations  Somatic delusions can occur in several forms  Most common are the person's conviction that he or she emits a foul odor from the skin  mouth  rectum  or vagina  that there is an infestation of insects on or in the skin  that there is an internal parasite  that certain parts of the body are definitely  contrary to all evidence  misshapen or ugly  or that parts of the body  e g   the large intestine  are not functioning Mixed Type  This subtype applies when no one delusional theme predominates  Unspecified Type  This subtype applies when the dominant delusional belief cannot be clearly determined or is not described in the specific types  e g   referential delusions without a prominent persecutory or grandiose component  Associated Features and DisordersSocial  marital  or work problems can result from the delusional beliefs of Delusional Disorder  Ideas of reference  e g   that random events are of special significance  are common in individuals with this disorder  Their interpretation of these events is usually consistent with the content of their delusional beliefs  Many individuals with Delusional Disorder develop irritable or dysphoric mood  which can usually be understood as a reaction to their delusional beliefs  Especially with the Persecutory and Jealous Types  marked anger and violent behavior can occur  The individual may engage in litigious behavior  sometimes leading to hundreds of letters of protest to government and judicial officials and many court appearances  Legal difficulties can occur in Delusional Disorder  Jealous Type and Erotomanic Type  Individuals with Delusional Disorder  Somatic Type  may be subject to unnecessary medical tests and procedures  Hearing deficiency  severe psychosocial stressors  e g   immigration   and low socioeconomic status may predispose an individual to the development of Delusional Disorder  Major Depressive Episodes probably occur in individuals with Delusional Disorder more frequently than in the general population  Typically the depression isrelativelymildand begins after the onset of prominent delusional beliefs  Delusional Disorder may be associated with Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder  Body Dysmorphic Disorder  and Paranoid  Schizoid  or Avoidant Personality Disorders Specific Culture and Gender FeaturesAn individual's cultural and religious background must be taken into account in evaluating the possible presence of Delusional Disorder  Some cultures have widely
held and culturally sanctioned beliefs that might be considered delusional in other cultures  The content of delusions also varies in different cultures and subcultures  Delusional Disorder  Jealous Type  is probably more common in men than in women  but there appears to be no major gender difference in the overall frequency of Delusional Disorder PrevalenceDelusional Disorder is relatively uncommon in clinical settings  with most studies suggesting that the disorder accounts for l%-2% of admissions to inpatient mental health facilities  Precise information about the population prevalence of this disorder islacking  but the best estimate is around 0 03%  Because of its usually late age at onset  the lifetime morbidity risk may be between 0 05% and 0 1% CourseThe age at onset of Delusional Disorder is generally middle or late adult life  but can be at a younger age  The Persecutory Type is the most common subtype  The course is quite variable  Especially in the Persecutory Type  the disorder may be chronic  although a waxing and waning of the preoccupation with the delusional beliefs often occurs  In other cases  full periods of remission may be followed by subsequent relapses  In yet other cases  the disorder remits within a few months  often without subsequent relapse  Some evidence suggests that the Jealous Type may have a better prognosis than the Persecutory Type Familial PatternSome studies have found that Delusional Disorder is more common among relatives of individuals with Schizophrenia than would be expected by chance  whereas other studies have found no familial relationship between Delusional Disorder and Schizo- phrenia  There is limited evidence that Avoidant and Paranoid Personality Disorders may be especially common among first-degree biological relatives of individuals with Delusional Disorder Differential DiagnosisThe diagnosis of Delusional Disorder is made only when the delusion is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition  Adelirium  a dementia  and Psychotic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition may present with symptoms that suggest Delusional Disorder  For example  simple persecu- tory delusions  e g   "someone comes into my room at night and steals my clothes"  in the early phase of Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type would be diagnosed as Dementia of the Alzheimer'sType  With Delusions  A Substance-InducedPsychotic Disorder  especially due to stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine  cross-sectionally may be identical in symptomatology to Delusional Disorder  but can usually be distinguished by the chronological relationship of substance use to the onset and remission of the delusional beliefs Delusional Disorder can be distinguished from Schizophrenia andSchizophreni-297 1 Delusional Disorder 299

delusional proportions  e g   the belief that one has caused the death of another person by having willed it   If the obsessions develop into sustained delusional beliefs that represent a major part of the clinical picture  an additional diagnosis of Delusional Disorder may be appropriate In contrast to Delusional Disorder  there are no clear-cut or persisting delusional beliefs in Paranoid Personality Disorder  Whenever a person with a Delusional Disorder has a preexisting Personality Disorder  the Personality Disorder should be listed on Axis II  followed by "Premorbid" in parentheses â€¢ Diagnostic criteria for 297 1 Delusional DisorderA  Nonbizarre delusions  i e   involving situations that occur in real life  such as being followed  poisoned  infected  loved at a distance  or deceived by spouse or lover  or having a disease  of at least 1 month's duration B  Criterion A for Schizophrenia has never been met  Note  Tactile and olfactory hallucinations may be present in Delusional Disorder if they are related to the delusional theme C  Apart from the impact of the delusion s  or its ramifications  functioning is not markedly impaired and behavior is not obviously odd or bizarre D  If mood episodes have occurred concurrently with delusions  their total duration has been brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods E  The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition Specify type  the following types are assigned based on the predominant delusional theme  ErotomanicType  delusions thatanother person  usuallyofhigherstatus  is in love with the individualGrandiose Type  delusions of inflated worth  power  knowledge  identity  or special relationship to a deity or famous personJealous Type  delusions that the individual's sexual partner is unfaithful Persecutory Type  delusions that the person  or someone to whom theperson is close  is being malevolently treated in some waySomatic Type  delusions that the person has some physical defect orgeneral medical conditionMixed Type  delusions characteristicof more than one of the above typesbut no one theme predominatesUnspecified Type297 1 Delusional Disorder 301

302 Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders 298 8 Brief Psychotic DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Brief Psychotic Disorder is a disturbance that involves the sudden onset of at least one of the following positive psychotic symptoms  delusions  halluci- nations  disorganized speech  e g   frequent derailment or incoherence   or grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior  Criterion A   An episode of the disturbance lasts at least 1 day but less than 1 month  and the individual eventually has a full return to the premorbid level of functioning  Criterion B   The disturbance is not better accounted for by a Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features  by Schizoaffective Disorder  or by Schizophrenia and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a hallucinogen  or a general medical condition  e g   subdural hematoma   Criterion C  SpecifiersThe following specifiers for Brief Psychotic Disorder may be noted based on the presence or absence of precipitatingstressors With Marked Stressor s   This specifier may be noted if the psychotic symp- toms develop shortly after and apparently in response to one or more events that  singly or together  would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in that person's culture  This type of Brief Psychotic Disorder was called "brief reactive psychosis" in DSM-III-R  The precipitating event s  may be any major stress  such as the loss of a loved one or the psychological trauma of combat  Determining whether a specific stressor was a precipitant or a conse- quence of the illness may sometimes be clinically difficult  In such instances  the decision will depend on related factors such as the temporal relationship between the stressor and the onset of the symptoms  ancillary information from a spouse or friend about level of functioning prior to the stressor  and history of similar responses to stressful events in the past Without Marked Stressor s   This specifier may be noted if the psychotic symptoms are not apparently in response to events that would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in the person's culture  With Postpartum Onset  This specifier may be noted if the onset of the psychotic symptoms is within 4 weeks postpartum Associated Features and DisordersIndividuals with Brief Psychotic Disorder typically experience emotional turmoil or overwhelming confusion  They may have rapid shifts from one intense affect to another  Although brief  the level of impairment may be severe  and supervision may be required to ensure that nutritional and hygienic needs are met and that the individual is protected from the consequences of poor judgment  cognitive impairment  or acting on the basis of delusions  There appears to be an increased risk of mortality with a particularly high risk for suicide   especially among younger individuals  Preexisting Personality Disorders  e g   Paranoid  Histrionic  Narcissistic  Schizotypal  or Borderline Personality Disorder  may predispose the individualto the development of the disorder 
298 8 Brief Psychotic Disorder 303Specific Culture FeaturesIt is important to distinguish symptoms of Brief Psychotic Disorder from culturally sanctioned response patterns  For example  in some religious ceremonies  an individual may report hearing voices  but these do not generally persist and are not perceived as abnormal by most members of the person's community PrevalenceLimited available evidence suggests that Brief Psychotic Disorder is uncommon CourseBrief Psychotic Disorder may appear in adolescence or early adulthood  with the average age at onset being in the late 20s or early 30s  By definition  a diagnosis of Brief Psychotic Disorder requires a full remission of all symptoms and a return to the premorbid level of functioning within 1 month of the onset of the disturbance  In some individuals  the duration of psychotic symptoms may be quite brief  e g   a few days  Familial PatternSome evidence suggests that Brief Psychotic Disorder may be related to Mood Disorders  whereas other evidence suggests that it may be distinct from both Schizophrenia and Mood Disorders Differential DiagnosisA wide variety of general medical conditions can present with psychotic symptoms of short duration  Psychotic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition or a delirium is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history  physical examination  or laboratory tests that indicates that the delusions or hallucinations are the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition  e g   Cushing's syndrome  brain tumor   see p  306   Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder  Sub- stance-Induced Delirium  and Substance Intoxication are distinguished from Brief Psychotic Disorder by the fact that a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the psychotic symptoms  see p  310   Laboratory tests  such as a urine drug screen or a blood alcohol level  may be helpful in making this determination  as may a careful history of substance use with attention to temporal relationships between substance intake and onset of the symptoms and the nature of the substance being used The diagnosis of Brief Psychotic Disorder cannot be made if the psychotic symptoms are better accounted for by a mood episode  i e   the psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during a full Major Depressive  Manic  or Mixed Episode   If the psychotic symptoms persist for 1 month or longer  the diagnosis is either Schizophreniform Disorder  Delusional Disorder  Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features  or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified  depending on the other symptoms in the presentation  The differential diagnosis between Brief Psychotic Disorder and Schizophreniform Disorder is difficult when the psychotic symptoms have remitted
304 Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disordersbefore 1 month in response to successful treatment with medication  Because recurrent episodes of Brief Psychotic Disorder are rare  careful attention should be given to the possibility that a recurrent disorder  e g   Bipolar Disorder  recurrent acute exacerbations of Schizophrenia  may be responsible for any recurring psychotic episodes An episode of Factitious Disorder  With Predominantly Psychological Signs and Symptoms  may have the appearance of Brief Psychotic Disorder  but in such cases there is evidence that the symptoms are intentionally produced  When Malingering involves apparently psychotic symptoms  there is usually evidence that the illness was feigned for an understandable goal In certain individuals with Personality Disorders  psychosocial stressors may precipitate brief periods of psychotic symptoms  These are usually transient and do not warrant a separate diagnosis  If psychotic symptoms persist for at least 1 day  an additional diagnosis of Brief Psychotic Disorder may be appropriate I Diagnostic criteria for 298 8 Brief Psychotic DisorderA  Presence of one  or more  of the following symptoms  1  delusions 2  hallucinations 3  disorganized speech  e g   frequent derailment or incoherence   4  grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviorNote  Do not include a symptom if it is a culturally sanctioned response pattern B  Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less than 1 month  with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning C  The disturbance is not better accounted for by a Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features  Schizoaffective Disorder  or Schizophrenia and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition Specify if With Marked Stressor s   brief reactive psychosis   if symptoms occurshortly after and apparently in response to events that  singly or together  would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in the person's cultureWithout Marked Stressor s   if psychotic symptoms do not occur shortly after  or are not apparently in response to events that  singly or together  would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in the person's cultureWith Postpartum Onset  if onset within 4 weeks postpartum

297 3 Shared Psychotic Disorder  Folie a Deux  305 297 3 Shared Psychotic Disorder  Folie a Deux Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Shared Psychotic Disorder  Folie a Deux  is a delusion that develops in an individual who is involved in a close relationship with another person  sometimes termed the "inducer" or "the primary case"  who already has a Psychotic Disorder with prominent delusions  Criterion A   The individual comes to share the delusional beliefs of the primary case in whole or in part  Criterion B   The delusion is not better accounted for by another Psychotic Disorder  e g   Schizophrenia  or a Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   amphetamine  or a general medical condition  e g   brain tumor   Criterion C   Schizophrenia is probably the most common diagnosis of the primary case  although other diagnoses may include Delusional Disorder or Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features  The content of the shared delusional beliefs may be dependent on the diagnosis of the primary case and can include relatively bizarre delusions  e g   that radiation is being transmitted into an apartment from a hostile foreign power  causing indigestion and diarrhea   mood-congruent delusions  e g   that the primary case will soon receive a film contract for $2 million  allowing the family to purchase a much larger home with a swimming pool   or the nonbizarre delusions that are characteristic of Delusional Disorder  e g   the FBI is tapping the family telephone and trailing family members when they go out   Usually the primary case in Shared Psychotic Disorder is dominant in the relationship and gradually imposes the delusional system on the more passive and initially healthy second person  Individuals who come to share delusional beliefs are often related by blood or marriage and have lived together for a long time  sometimes in relative social isolation  If the relationship with the primary case is interrupted  the delusional beliefs of the other individual usually diminish or disappear  Although most commonly seen in relationships of only two people  Shared Psychotic Disorder can occur among a larger number of individuals  especially in family situations in which the parent is the primary case and the children  sometimes to varying degrees  adopt the parent's delusional beliefs  Individuals with this disorder rarely seek treatment and usually are brought to clinical attention when the primary case receives treatment Associated Features and DisordersAside from the delusional beliefs  behavior is usually not otherwise odd or unusual in Shared Psychotic Disorder  Impairment is often less severe in the individual with Shared Psychotic Disorder than in the primary case PrevalenceLittle systematic information about the prevalence of Shared Psychotic Disorder is available  This disorder is rare in clinical settings  although it has been argued that some cases go unrecognized  Limited evidence suggests that Shared Psychotic Disorder is somewhat more common in women than in men 
306 Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic DisordersCourseLittle is known about the age at onset of Shared Psychotic Disorder  but it appears to be quite variable  Without intervention  the course is usually chronic  because this disorder most commonly occurs in relationships that are long-standing and resistant to change  With separation from the primary case  the individual's delusional beliefs disappear  sometimes quickly and sometimes quite slowly Differential DiagnosisThe diagnosis of Shared Psychotic Disorder is made only when the delusion is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition  Differential diagnosis is rarely a problem because the history of close association with the primary case and the similarity of delusions between the two individuals is unique to Shared Psychotic Disorder  In Schizophrenia  Delusional Disorder  Schizoaffec- tive Disorder  andMood Disorder With Psychotic Features  there is either no close relationship with a dominant person who has a Psychotic Disorder and shares similar delusional beliefs or  if there is such a person  the psychotic symptoms usually precede the onset of any shared delusions  In rare cases  an individual may present with what appears to be Shared Psychotic Disorder  but the delusions do not disappear when the individual is separated from the primary case  In such a situation  it is probably appropriate to consider another Psychotic Disorder diagnosis Diagnostic criteria for 297 3 Shared Psychotic DisorderA  Adelusiondevelopsinanindividualinthecontextofacloserelationship with another person s   who has an already-established delusion B  The delusion is similar in content to that of the person who already has the established delusion C  The disturbance is not better accounted for by another Psychotic Disorder  e g   Schizophrenia  or a Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition 
Psychotic Disorder Due to a General MedicalConditionDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of Psychotic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition are prominent hallucinations or delusions that are judged to be due to the direct physiolog- ical effects of a general medical condition  Criterion A   There must be evidence from
Psychotic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition 307the history  physical examination  or laboratory findings that the delusions or hallucina- tions are the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition  Criterion B   The psychotic disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder  e g   the symptoms are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe general medical condition  in which case a diagnosis of Brief Psychotic Disorder  With Marked Stressor  would be appropriate   Criterion C   The diagnosis is not made if the disturbance occurs only during the course of a delirium  Criterion D   A separate diagnosis of Psychotic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition is not given if delusions occur only during the course of Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type or Vascular Dementia  a diagnosis of Dementia of the Alzheimer'sType or VascularDementia with the subtype With Delusions is given instead Hallucinations can occur in any sensory modality  i e   visual  olfactory  gustatory  tactile  or auditory   but certain etiological factors are likely to evoke specific hallucina- tory phenomena  Olfactory hallucinations  especially those involving the smell of burning rubber or other unpleasant smells  are highly suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy  Hallucinations may vary from simple and unformed to highly complex and organized  depending on etiological factors  environmental surroundings  nature and focus of the insult rendered to the central nervous system  and the reactive response to impairment  Psychotic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition is generally not diagnosed if the individual maintains reality testing for the hallucination and appreciates that the perceptual experiences result from the general medical condition  Delusions may express a variety of themes  including somatic  grandiose  religious  and  most commonly  persecutory  Religious delusions have been specifically associated in some cases with temporal lobe epilepsy  Individuals with right parietal brain lesions can develop a contralateral neglect syndrome in which they may disown parts of their body to a delusional extent  On the whole  however  associations between delusions and particular general medical conditions appear to be less specific than is the case for hallucinations In determining whether the psychotic disturbance is due to a general medical condition  the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical condition  Further  the clinician must establish that the psychotic disturbance is etiologically related to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism  A careful and comprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment  Although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the psychotic disturbance and the general medical condition is etiological  several considerations provide some guidance in this area  One consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset  exacerbation  or remission of the general medical condition and that of the psychotic disturbance  A second consideration is the presence of features that are atypical for a primary Psychotic Disorder  e g   atypical age at onset or presence of visual or olfactory hallucinations   Evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a direct association between the general medical condition in question and the development of psychotic symptoms can provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation  In addition  the clinician must also judge that the disturbance is not better accounted for by a primary Psychotic Disorder  a Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder  or another primary mental disorder  e g   Adjust- ment Disorder   This determination is explained in greater detail in the "Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition" section  p  165

presence of a depressed mood can be inferred from the person's facial expression and demeanor  Some individuals emphasize somatic complaints  e g   bodily aches and pains  rather than reporting feelings of sadness  Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability  e g   persistent anger  a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others  or an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters   In children and adolescents  an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood  This presentation should be differentiated from a "spoiled child" pattern of irritability when frustrated Loss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present  at least to some degree  Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies  "not caring anymore " or not feeling any enjoyment in activitiesthat were previously considered pleasurable Criterion A2   Family members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations  e g   a formerly avid golfer no longer plays  a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to practice   In some individuals  there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire Appetite is usually reduced  and many individuals feel that they have to force themselves to eat  Other individuals  particularly those encountered in ambulatory settings  may have increased appetite and may crave specific foods  e g   sweets or other carbohydrates   When appetite changes are severe  in either direction   there may be a significant loss or gain in weight  or  in children  a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted  Criterion A3  The most common sleep disturbance associated with a Major Depressive Episode is insomnia  Criterion A4   Individuals typically have middle insomnia  i e   waking up during the night and having difficulty returning to sleep  or terminal insomnia  i e   waking too early and being unable to return to sleep   Initial insomnia  i e   difficulty falling asleep  may also occur  Less frequently  individuals present with oversleeping  hypersomnia  in the form of prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep  Sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the disturbed sleep Psychomotor changes include agitation  e g   the inability to sit still  pacing  hand-wringing  or pulling or rubbing of the skin  clothing  or other objects  or retardation  e g   slowed speech  thinking  and body movements  increased pauses before answer- ing  speech that is decreased in volume  inflection  amount  or variety of content  or muteness   Criterion A5   The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe enough to be observable by others and not represent merely subjective feelings Decreased energy  tiredness  and fatigue are common  Criterion A6   A person may report sustained fatigue without physical exertion  Even the smallest tasks seem to require substantial effort  The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced  For example  an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are exhausting and take twice as long as usual The sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a Major Depressive Episode may include unrealistic negative evaluations of one's worth or guilty preoccupations or ruminations over minor past failings  Criterion A7   Such individuals often misinterpret neutral or trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense of responsibility for untoward events  For example  a realtor may become preoccupied with self-blame for failing to make sales even when the market has collapsed generally and other realtors are equally unable to make sales  The sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delusional proportions  e g   an individual who is convinced that he or she is personally responsible for world poverty   Blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet occupational or interpersonal responsibilities as aMajor Depressive Episode 321
322 Mood Disordersresult of the depression is very common and  unless delusional  is not considered sufficient to meet this criterion Many individuals report impaired ability to think  concentrate  or make decisions  Criterion A8   They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory difficulties  Those in intellectually demanding academic or occupational pursuits are often unable to function adequately even when they have mild concentration problems  e g   a computer programmer who can no longer perform complicated but previously manage- able tasks   In children  a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration  In elderly individuals with a Major Depressive Episode  memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs of a dementia  "pseudodementia"   When the Major Depressive Episode is successfully treated  the memory problems often fully abate  However  in some individuals  particularly elderly persons  a Major Depres sive Episode may sometimes be the initial presentation of an irreversible dementia Frequently there may be thoughts of death  suicidal ideation  or suicide attempts  Criterion A9   These thoughts range from a belief that others would be better off if the person were dead  to transient but recurrent thoughts of committing suicide  to actual specific plans of how to commit suicide  The frequency  intensity  and lethality of these thoughts can be quite variable  Less severely suicidal individuals may report transient  1- to 2-minute   recurrent  once or twice a week  thoughts  More severely suicidal individuals may have acquired materials  e g   a rope or a gun  to be used in the suicide attempt and may have established a location and time when they will be isolated from others so that they can accomplish the suicide  Although these behaviors are associated statistically with suicide attempts and may be helpful in identifying a high-risk group  many studies have shown that it is not possible to predict accurately whether or when a particular individual with depression will attempt suicide  Motivations for suicide may include a desire to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles or an intense wish to end an excruciatingly painful emotional state that is perceived by the person to be without end A diagnosis of a Major Depressive Episode is not made if the symptoms meet criteria for a Mixed Episode  Criterion B   A Mixed Episode is characterized by the symptoms of both a Manic Episode and a Major Depressive Episode occurring nearly every day for at least a 1-week period The degree of impairment associated with a Major Depressive Episode varies  but even in mild cases  there must be either clinicallysignificant distress or some interference in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion C   If impairment is severe  the person may lose the ability to function socially or occupation- ally  In extreme cases  the person may be unable to perform minimal self-care  e g   feeding or clothing self  or to maintain minimal personal hygiene A careful interview is essential to elicit symptoms of a Major Depressive Episode  Reporting may be compromised by difficulties in concentrating  impaired memory  or a tendency to deny  discount  or explain away symptoms  Information from additional informants can be especially helpful in clarifying the course of current or prior Major Depressive Episodes and in assessing whether there have been any Manic or Hypomanic Episodes  Because Major Depressive Episodes can begin gradually  a review of clinical information that focuses on the worst part of the current episode may be most likely to detect the presence of symptoms  The evaluation of the symptoms of a Major Depressive Episode is especially difficult when they occur in an individual who also has a general medical condition  e g   cancer  stroke  myocardial infarction  diabetes   Some of the criterion items of a Major Depressive Episode are identical to the characteristic signs and
symptoms of general medical conditions  e g   weight loss with untreated diabetes  fatigue with cancer   Such symptoms should count toward a Major Depressive Episode except when they are clearly and fully accounted for by a general medical condition  For example  weight loss in a person with ulcerative colitis who has many bowel movements and little food intake should not be counted toward a Major Depressive Episode  On the other hand  when sadness  guilt  insomnia  or weight loss are present in a person with a recent myocardial infarction  each symptom would count toward a Major Depressive Episode because these are not clearly and fully accounted for by the physiological effects of a myocardial infarction  Similarly  when symptoms are clearly due to mood-incongruent delusions or hallucinations  e g   a 30-pound weight loss related to not eating because of a delusion that one's food is being poisoned   these symptoms do not count toward a Major Depressive Episode By definition  a Major Depressive Episode is not due to the direct physiological effects of a drug of abuse  e g   in the context of Alcohol Intoxication or Cocaine Withdrawal   to the side effects of medications or treatments  e g   steroids   or to toxin exposure  Similarly  the episode is not due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition  e g   hypothyroidism   Criterion D   Moreover  if the symptoms begin within 2 months of the loss of a loved one and do not persist beyond these 2 months  they are generally considered to result from Bereavement  see p  684   unless they are associated with marked functional impairment or include morbid preoccupation with worthlessness  suicidal ideation  psychotic symptoms  or psychomotor retardation  Criterion E  Associated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Individuals with a Major Depressive Episode frequently present with tearfulness  irritability  brooding  obsessive rumination  anxiety  phobias  excessive worry over physical health  and complaints of pain  e g   headaches or joint  abdominal  or other pains   During a Major Depressive Episode  some individuals have Panic Attacks that occur in a pattern that meets criteria for Panic Disorder  In children  separation anxiety may occur  Some individuals note difficulty in intimate relationships  less satisfying social interactions  or difficulties in sexual functioning  e g   anorgasmia in women or erectile dysfunction in men   There may be marital problems  e g   divorce   occupational problems  e g   loss of job   academic problems  e g   truancy  school failure   Alcohol or Other Substance Abuse  or increased utilization of medical services  The most serious consequence of a Major Depressive Episode is attempted or completed suicide  Suicide risk is especially high for individuals with psychotic features  a history of previous suicide attempts  a family history of completed suicides  or concurrent substance use  There may also be an increased rate of premature death from general medical conditions  Major Depressive Episodes often follow psychosocial stressors  e g   the death of a loved one  marital separation  divorce   Childbirth may precipitate a Major Depressive Episode  in which case the specifier With Postpartum Onset is noted  see p  386  Associated laboratory findings  No laboratory findings that are diagnostic of a Major Depressive Episode have been identified  However  a variety of laboratory findings have been noted to be abnormal in groups of individualswith Major Depressive Episodes compared with control subjects  It appears that the same laboratory abnormalities areMajor Depressive Episode 323
324 Mood Disordersassociated with a Major Depressive Episode regardless of whether the episode is part of a Major Depressive  Bipolar I  or Bipolar II Disorder  Most laboratory abnormalities are state dependent  i e   affected by the presence or absence of depressive symptoms   but some findings may precede the onset of the episode or persist after its remission  Laboratory tests are more likely to be abnormal in episodes with melancholic or psychotic features and in more severely depressed individuals Sleep EEG abnormalities may be evident in 40%-60% of outpatients and in up to 90% of inpatients with a Major Depressive Episode  The most frequently associated polysomnographic findings include 1  sleep continuity disturbances  such as prolonged sleep latency  increased intermittent wakefulness  and early morning awakening  2  reduced nonâ€”rapid eye movement  NREM  stages 3 and 4 sleep  slow-wave sleep   with a shift in slow-wave activity away from the first NREM period  3  decreased rapid eye movement  REM  latency  i e   shortened duration of the first NREM period   4  increased phasic REM activity  i e   the number of actual eye movements during REM   and 5  increased duration of REMsleep early in the night  Some evidence suggests that these sleep abnormalities may sometimes persist after clinical remission or may precede the onset of the initial Major Depressive Episode Neurotransmitters implicated in the pathophysiology of a Major Depressive Episode include norepinephrine  serotonin  acetylcholine  dopamine  and gamma-aminobutyric acid  Evidence that implicates these neurotransmitters includes measures of their levels in blood  cerebrospinal fluid  or urine and platelet receptor functioning  Other laboratory tests that have demonstrated abnormalities include the dexamethasone suppression test  other neuroendocrine challenges  functional and structural brain imaging  evoked potentials  and waking EEG Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesCulture can influence the experience and communication of symptoms of depression  Underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis can be reduced by being alert to ethnic and cultural specificity in the presenting complaints of a Major Depressive Episode  For example  in some cultures  depression may be experienced largely in somatic terms  rather than with sadness or guilt  Complaints of "nerves" and headaches  in Latino and Mediterranean cultures   of weakness  tiredness  or "imbalance"  in Chinese and Asian cultures   of problems of the "heart"  in Middle Eastern cultures   or of being "heartbroken"  among Hopi  may express the depressive experience  Such presentations combine features of the Depressive  Anxiety  and Somatoform Disorders  Cultures also may differ in judgments about the seriousness of experiencing or expressing dysphoria  e g   irritability may provoke greater concern than sadness or withdrawal   Culturally distinctive experiences  e g   fear of being hexed or bewitched  feelings of "heat in the head" or crawling sensations of worms or ants  or vivid feelings of being visited by those who have died  must be distinguished from actual hallucinations or delusions that may be part of a Major Depressive Episode  With Psychotic Features  It is also imperative that the clinician not routinely dismiss a symptom merely because it is viewed as the "norm" for a culture The core symptoms of a Major Depressive Episode are the same for children and adolescents  although there are data that suggest that the prominence of characteristic symptoms may change with age  Certain symptoms such as somatic complaints  irritability  and social withdrawal are particularly common in children  whereas psycho-
motor retardation  hypersomnia  and delusions are less common in prepuberty than in adolescence and adulthood  In prepubertal children  Major Depressive Episodes occur more frequently in conjunction with other mental disorders  especially Disruptive Behavior Disorders  Attention-Deficit Disorders  and Anxiety Disorders  than in isolation  In adolescents  Major Depressive Episodes are frequently associated with Disruptive Behavior Disorders  Attention-Deficit Disorders  Anxiety Disorders  Substance-Related Disorders  and Eating Disorders  In elderly adults  cognitive symptoms  e g   disorienta- tion  memory loss  and distractibility  may be particularlyprominent A significant proportion of women report a worsening of the symptoms of a Major Depressive Episode several days before the onset of menses  Studies indicate that depressive episodes occur twice as frequently in women as in men  See the correspond- ing sections of the texts for Major Depressive Disorder  p  341   Bipolar I Disorder  p  352   and Bipolar II Disorder  p  360  for specific information on gender CourseSymptoms of a Major Depressive Episode usually develop over days to weeks  A prodromal period that may include anxiety symptoms and mild depressive symptoms may last for weeks to months before the onset of a full Major Depressive Episode  The duration of a Major Depressive Episode is also variable  An untreated episode typically lasts 6 months or longer  regardless of age at onset  In a majority of cases  there is complete remission of symptoms  and functioning returns to the premorbid level  In a significant proportion of cases  perhaps 20%-30%   some depressive symptoms insuffi- cient to meet full criteria for a Major Depressive Episode may persist for months to years and may be associated with some disability or distress  in which case the specifier In Partial Remission may be noted  p  377   Partial remission following a Major Depressive Episode appears to be predictive of a similar pattern after subsequent episodes  In some individuals  5%-10%   the full criteria for a Major Depressive Episode continue to be met for 2 or more years  in which case the specifier Chronic may be noted  see p 382  Differential DiagnosisA Major Depressive Episode must be distinguished from a Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  The appropriate diagnosis would be Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition  e g   multiple sclerosis  stroke  hypothyroidism   see p  366   This determination is based on the history  laboratory findings  or physical examination  If both a Major Depressive Episode and a general medical condition are present but it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition  then the primary Mood Disorder is recorded on Axis I  e g   Major Depressive Disorder  and the general medical condition is recorded on Axis III  e g   myocardial infarction   This would be the case  for example  if the Major Depressive Episode is considered to be the psychological consequence of having the general medical condition or if there is no etiological relationship between the Major Depressive Episode and the general medical condition A Substance-Induced Mood Disorder is distinguished from a Major Depressive Episode by the fact that a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a toxin  isMajor Depressive Episode 325
326 Mood Disordersjudged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance  see p  370   For example  depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would be diagnosed as Cocaine-Induced Mood Disorder  With Depressive Features  With Onset During Withdrawal In elderly persons  it is often difficult to determine whether cognitive symptoms  e g   disorientation  apathy  difficulty concentrating  memory loss  are better accounted for by a dementia or by a Major Depressive Episode  A thorough medical evaluation and an evaluation of the onset of the disturbance  temporal sequencing of depressive and cognitive symptoms  course of illness  and treatment response are helpful in making this determination  The premorbid state of the individual may help to differentiate a Major Depressive Episode from a dementia  In a dementia  there is usually a premorbid history of declining cognitive function  whereas the individual with a Major Depressive Episode is much more likely to have a relatively normal premorbid state and abrupt cognitive decline associated with the depression Major Depressive Episodes with prominent irritable mood may be difficult to distinguish from Manic Episodes with irritable mood or from Mixed Episodes  This distinction requires a careful clinical evaluation of the presence of manic symptoms  If criteria are met for both a Manic Episode and a Major Depressive Episode  except for the 2-week duration  nearly every day for at least a 1-week period  this would constitute a Mixed Episode Distractibility and low frustration tolerance can occur in both Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder and a Major Depressive Episode  if the criteria are met for both  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder may be diagnosed in addition to the Mood Disorder  However  the clinician must be cautious not to overdiagnose a Major Depressive Episode in children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder whose disturbance in mood is characterized by irritability rather than by sadness or loss of interest A Major Depressive Episode that occurs in response to a psychosocial stressor is distinguished from Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood by the fact that the full criteria for a Major Depressive Episode are not met in Adjustment Disorder  After the loss of a loved one  even if depressive symptoms are of sufficient duration and number to meet criteria for a Major Depressive Episode  they should be attributed to Bereavement rather than to a Major Depressive Episode  unless they persist for more than 2 months or include marked functional impairment  morbid preoccupation with worthlessness  suicidal ideation  psychotic symptoms  or psychomotor retardation Finally  periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human experience  These periods should not be diagnosed as a Major Depressive Episode unless criteria are met for severity  i e   five out of nine symptoms   duration  i e   most of the day  nearly every day for at least 2 weeks   and clinically significant distress or impairment  The diagnosis Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified may be appropriate for presentations of depressed mood with clinically significant impairment that do not meet criteria for duration or severity 
Criteria for Major Depressive EpisodeA  Five  or more  of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning  at least one of the symptoms is either  1  depressed mood or  2  loss of interest or pleasure Note  Do not include symptoms that are clearly due to a general medical condition  or mood-incongruent delusions orhallucinations  1  depressed mood most of the day  nearly every day  as indicated by either subjective report  e g   feels sad or empty  or observation made by others  e g   appears tearful   Note  In children and adolescents  can be irritable mood  2  markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all  or almost all  activities most of the day  nearly every day  as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others  3  significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain  e g   a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month   or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day  Note  In children  consider failure to make expected weight gains  4  insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day 5  psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day  observableby others  not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or beingslowed down  6  fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day 7  feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt  whichmay be delusional  nearly every day  not merely self-reproach orguilt about being sick  8  diminished abilityto think or concentrate  or indecisiveness  nearlyevery day  either by subjective account or as observed by others  9  recurrent thoughts of death  not just fear of dying   recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan  or a suicide attempt or aspecific plan for committing suicideB  The symptoms do not meet criteria for a Mixed Episode  see p  335  C  The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning D  The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition  e g   hypothyroidism  E  The symptoms are not better accounted for by Bereavement  i e   after the loss of a loved one  the symptoms persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment  morbid preoc- cupation with worthlessness  suicidal ideation  psychotic symptoms  or psychomotor retardation Major Depressive Episode 327
328 Mood DisordersEpisode FeaturesManic EpisodeA Manic Episode is defined by a distinct period during which there is an abnormally and persistently elevated  expansive  or irritable mood  This period of abnormal mood must last at least 1 week  or less if hospitalization is required   Criterion A   The mood disturbance must be accompanied by at least three additional symptoms from a list that includes inflated self-esteem or grandiosity  decreased need for sleep  pressure of speech  flight of ideas  distractibility  increased involvement in goal-directed activities or psycho motor agitation  and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities with a high potential for painful consequences  If the mood is irritable  rather than elevated or expansive   at least four of the above symptoms must be present  Criterion B   The symptoms do not meet criteria for a Mixed Episode  which is characterized by the symptoms of both a Manic Episode and a Major Depressive Episode occurring nearly every day for at least a 1-week period  Criterion C   The disturbance must be sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalization  or it is characterized by the presence of psychotic features  Criterion D   The episode must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a drug of abuse  a medication  other somatic treatments for depression  e g   electroconvulsive therapy or light therapy  or toxin exposure  The episode must also not be due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition  e g   multiple sclerosis  brain tumor   Criterion E  The elevated mood of a Manic Episode may be described as euphoric  unusually good  cheerful  or high  Although the person's mood may initially have an infectious quality for the uninvolved observer  it is recognized as excessive by those who know the person well  The expansive quality of the mood is characterized by unceasing and indiscriminate enthusiasm for interpersonal  sexual  or occupational interactions  For example  the person may spontaneously start extensive conversations with strangers in public places  or a salesperson may telephone strangers at home in the early morning hours to initiate sales  Although elevated mood is considered the prototypical symptom  the predominant mood disturbance may be irritability  particularly when the person's wishes are thwarted  Lability of mood  e g   the alternation between euphoria and irritability  is frequently seen Inflated self-esteem is typically present  ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked grandiosity  and may reach delusional proportions  Criterion Bl   Individuals may give advice on matters about which they have no special knowledge  e g   how to run the United Nations   Despite lack of any particular experience or talent  the individual may embark on writing a novel or composing a symphony or seek publicity for some impractical invention  Grandiose delusions are common  e g   having a special relation- ship to God or to some public figure from the political  religious  or entertainment world  Almost invariably  there is a decreased need for sleep  Criterion B2   The person usually awakens several hours earlier than usual  feeling full of energy  When the sleep disturbance is severe  the person may go for days without sleep and yet not feel tired Manic speech is typically pressured  loud  rapid  and difficult to interrupt  Criterion B3   Individuals may talk nonstop  sometimes for hours on end  and without regard for others' wishes to communicate  Speech is sometimes characterized by joking  punning  and amusing irrelevancies  The individual may become theatrical  with dramatic mannerisms and singing  Sounds rather than meaningful conceptual relationships may govern word choice  i e   clanging   If the person's mood is more irritablethan expansive 
speech may be marked by complaints  hostile comments  or angry tirades The individual's thoughts may race  often at a rate faster than can be articulated  Criterion B4   Some individuals with Manic Episodes report that this experience resembles watching two or three television programs simultaneously  Frequently there is flight of ideas evidenced by a nearly continuous flow of accelerated speech  with abrupt changes from one topic to another  For example  while talking about a potential business deal to sell computers  a salesperson may shift to discussing in minute detail the history of the computer chip  the industrial revolution  or applied mathematics  Whenflight of ideas is severe  speech may become disorganized and incoherent  Distractibility  Criterion B5  is evidenced by an inability to screen out irrelevant external stimuli  e g   the interviewer's tie  background noises or conversations  or furnishings in the room   There may be a reduced ability to differentiate between thoughts that are germane to the topic and thoughts that are only slightly relevant orclearly irrelevant The increase in goal-directed activity often involves excessive planning of  andexcessive participation in  multiple activities  e g   sexual  occupational  political  reli- gious   Criterion B6   Increased sexual drive  fantasies  and behavior are often present  The person may simultaneously take on multiple new business ventures without regard for the apparent risks or the need to complete each venture satisfactorily  Almost invariably  there is increased sociability  e g   renewing old acquaintances or calling friends or even strangers at all hours of the day or night   without regard to the intrusive  domineering  and demanding nature of these interactions  Individuals often display psychomotor agitation or restlessness by pacing or by holding multiple conversations simultaneously  e g   by telephone and in person at the same time   Some individuals write a torrent of letters on many different topics to friends  public figures  or the media Expansiveness  unwarranted optimism  grandiosity  and poor judgment often lead to an imprudent involvement in pleasurable activities such as buying sprees  reckless driving  foolish business investments  and sexual behavior unusual for the person  even though these activities are likely to have painful consequences  Criterion B7   The individual may purchase many unneeded items  e g   20 pairs of shoes  expensive antiques  without the money to pay for them  Unusual sexual behavior may include infidelity or indiscriminate sexual encounters with strangers The impairment resulting from the disturbance must be severe enough to cause marked impairment in functioning or to require hospitalization to protect the individual from the negative consequences of actions that result from poor judgment  e g   financial losses  illegal activities  loss of employment  assaultive behavior   By definition  the presence of psychotic features during a Manic Episode constitutes marked impairment in functioning  Criterion D  Symptoms like those seen in a Manic Episode may be due to the direct effects of antidepressant medication  electroconvulsive therapy  light therapy  or medication prescribed for other general medical conditions  e g   corticosteroids   Such presentations are not considered Manic Episodes and do not count toward the diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder  For example  if a person with recurrent Major Depressive Disorder develops manic symptoms following a course of antidepressant medication  the episode is diagnosed as a Substance-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  and there is no switch from a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder to Bipolar I Disorder  Some evidence suggests that there may be a bipolar "diathesis" in individuals who develop manic-like episodes following somatic treatment for depression  Such individuals may have an increased likelihood of future Manic  Mixed  or Hypomanic Episodes that areManic Episode 329
330 Mood Disordersnot related to substances or somatic treatments for depression  This may be an especially important consideration in children and adolescents Associated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Individuals with a Manic Episode frequently do not recognize that they are ill and resist efforts to be treated  They may travel impulsively to other cities  losing contact with relatives and caretakers  They may change their dress  makeup  or personal appearance to a more sexually suggestive or dramatically flamboyant style that is out of character for them  They may engage in activities that have a disorganized or bizarre quality  e g   distributing candy  money  or advice to passing strangers   Gambling and antisocial behaviors may accompany the Manic Episode  Ethical concerns may be disregarded even by those who are typically very conscientious  e g   a stockbroker inappropriately buys and sells stock without the clients' knowledge or permission  a scientist incorporates the findings of others   The person may be hostile and physically threatening to others  Some individuals  especially those with psychotic features  may become physically assaultive or suicidal  Adverse consequences of a Manic Episode  e g   involuntary hospitalization  difficulties with the law  or serious financial difficulties  often result from poor judgment and hyperactivity  When no longer in the Manic Episode  most individuals are regretful for behaviors engaged in during the Manic Episode  Some individuals describe having a much sharper sense of smell  hearing  or vision  e g   colors appear very bright   When catatonic symptoms  e g   stupor  mutism  negativism  and posturing  are present  the specifier With Catatonic Features may be indicated  see p  382  Mood may shift rapidly to anger or depression  Depressive symptoms may last moments  hours  or  more rarely  days  Not uncommonly  the depressive symptoms and manic symptoms occur simultaneously  If the criteria for both a Major Depressive Episode and a Manic Episode are prominent every day for at least 1 week  the episode is considered to be a Mixed Episode  see p  333   As the Manic Episode develops  there is often a substantial increase in the use of alcohol or stimulants  which may exacerbate or prolong the episode Associated laboratory findings  No laboratory findings that are diagnostic of a Manic Episode have been identified  However  a variety of laboratory findings have been noted to be abnormal in groups of individuals with Manic Episodes compared with control subjects  Laboratory findings in Manic Episodes include polysomnographic abnormalities  increased cortisol secretion  and absence of dexamethasone nonsuppres- sion  There may be abnormalities involving the norepinephrine  serotonin  acetylcholine  dopamine  or gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter systems  as demonstrated by studies of neurotransmitter metabolites  receptor functioning  pharmacological provoca- tion  and neuroendocrine function Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesCultural considerations that were suggested for Major Depressive Episodes are also relevant to Manic Episodes  see p  324   Manic Episodes in adolescents are more likel to include psychotic features and may be associated with school truancy  antisocial behavior  school failure  or substance use A significant minority of adolescents appear
to have a history of long-standing behavior problems that precede the onset of a frank Manic Episode  It is unclear whether these problems represent a prolonged prodrome to Bipolar Disorder or an independent disorder  See the corresponding sections of the texts for Bipolar I Disorder  p  352  and Bipolar II Disorder  p  360  for specific information on gender CourseThe mean age at onset for a first Manic Episode is the early 20s  but some cases start in adolescence and others start after age 50years  Manic Episodes typicallybegin suddenly  with a rapid escalation of symptoms over a few days  Frequently  Manic Episodes occur following psychosocial stressors  The episodes usually last from a few weeks to several months and are briefer and end more abruptly than Major Depressive Episodes  In many instances  50%-60%   a Major Depressive Episode immediately precedes or immediately follows a Manic Episode  with no intervening period of euthymia  If the Manic Episode occurs in the postpartum period  there may be an increased risk for recurrence in subsequent postpartum periods and the specifier With Postpartum Onset is applicable  see p  386  Differential DiagnosisA Manic Episode must be distinguished from a Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  The appropriate diagnosis would be Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physio- logical consequence of a specific general medical condition  e g   multiple sclerosis  brain tumor  Cushing's syndrome   see p  366   This determination is based on the history  laboratory findings  or physical examination  If it is judged that the manic symptoms are not the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition  then the primary Mood Disorder is recorded on Axis I  e g   Bipolar I Disorder  and the general medical condition is recorded on Axis III  e g   myocardial infarction   A late onset of a first Manic Episode  e g   after age 50 years  should alert the clinician to the possibility of an etiological general medical condition or substance A Substance-Induced Mood Disorder is distinguished from a Manic Episode by the fact that a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance  see p  370   Symptoms like those seen in a Manic Episode may be precipitated by a drug of abuse  e g   manic symptoms that occur only in the context of intoxication with cocaine would be diagnosed as Cocaine-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  With Onset During Intoxica- tion   Symptoms like those seen in a Manic Episode may also be precipitated by antidepressant treatment such as medication  electroconvulsive therapy  or light therapy  Such episodes are also diagnosed as Substance-Induced Mood Disorders  e g   Amitrip- tyline-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  Electroconvulsive Therapy- Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  Manic Episodes should be distinguished from Hypomanic Episodes  Although Manic Episodes and Hypomanic Episodes have an identical list of characteristic symptoms  the disturbance in Hypomanic Episodes is not sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalization  Some Hypomanic Episodes may evolve into full Manic Episodes Major Depressive Episodes with prominent irritable mood may be difficult toManic Episode 331
332 Mood Disordersdistinguish from Manic Episodes with irritable mood or from Mixed Episodes  This determination requires a careful clinical evaluation of the presence of manic symptoms  If criteria are met for both a Manic Episode and a Major Depressive Episode nearly every day for at least a 1-week period  this would constitute a Mixed Episode Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and a Manic Episode are both charac- terized by excessive activity impulsive behavior  poor judgment  and denial of problems  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is distinguished from a Manic Episode by its characteristic early onset  i e   before age 7 years   chronic rather than episodic course  lack of relatively clear onsets and offsets  and the absence of abnormally expansive or elevated mood or psychotic features Criteria for Manic EpisodeA  A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated  expansive  or irritable mood  lasting at least 1 week  or any duration if hospitalization is necessary  B  Duringtheperiodofmooddisturbance three ormore ofthefollowing symptoms have persisted  four if the mood is only irritable  and have been present to a significant degree  1  inflated self-esteem or grandiosity 2  decreased need for sleep  e g   feels rested after only 3 hours ofsleep  3  more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking 4  flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing 5  distractibility  i e   attention too easily drawn to unimportant orirrelevant external stimuli  6  increase in goal-directed activity  either socially  at work or school or sexually  or psychomotor agitation 7  excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a highpotential for painful consequences  e g   engaging in unrestrained buying sprees  sexual indiscretions  or foolish business invest- ments C  The symptoms do not meet criteria for a Mixed Episode  see p  335  D  The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social activities or relationships with others  or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others  or there are psychotic features E  The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or other treatment  or a general medical condition  e g   hyperthyroidism  Note  Manic-like episodes that are clearly caused by somatic antidepressant treatment  e g   medication  electroconvulsive therapy  light therapy  should not count toward a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder 
Episode FeaturesMixed EpisodeA Mixed Episode is characterized by a period of time  lasting at least 1 week  in which the criteria are met both for a Manic Episode and for a Major Depressive Episode nearly every day  Criterion A   The individual experiences rapidly alternating moods  sadness  irritability  euphoria  accompanied by symptoms of a Manic Episode  see p  328  and a Major Depressive Episode  see p  320   The symptom presentation frequently includes agitation  insomnia  appetite dysregulation  psychotic features  and suicidal thinking  The disturbance must be sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalization  or it is characterized by the presence of psychotic features  Criterion B   The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or other treatment  or a general medical condition  e g   hyperthyroidism   Criterion C   Symp- toms like those seen in a Mixed Episode may be due to the direct effects of antidepressant medication  electroconvulsive therapy  light therapy  or medication prescribed for other general medical conditions  e g   corticosteroids   Such presentations are not considered Mixed Episodes and do not count toward a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder  For example  if a person with recurrent Major Depressive Disorder develops a mixed symptom picture during a course of antidepressant medication  the diagnosis of the episode is Substance- Induced Mood Disorder  With Mixed Features  and there is no switch from a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder to Bipolar I Disorder  Some evidence suggests that there may be a bipolar "diathesis" in individuals who develop mixed-like episodes following somatic treatment for depression  Such individuals may have an increased likelihood of future Manic  Mixed  or Hypomanic Episodes that are not related to substances or somatic treatments for depression  This may be an especially important consideration in children and adolescents Associated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Associated features of a Mixed Episode are similar to those for Manic Episodes and Major Depressive Episodes  Individuals may be disorganized in their thinking or behavior  Because individuals in Mixed Episodes experience more dysphoria than do those in Manic Episodes  they may be more likely to seek help Associated laboratory findings  Laboratoryfindings for MixedEpisode are not well studied  although evidence to date suggests physiological and endocrine findings that are similar to those found in severe Major Depressive Episodes Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesCultural considerations suggested for Major Depressive Episodes are relevant to Mixed Episodes as well  see p  324   Mixed episodes appear to be more common in younger individuals and in individuals over age 60 years with Bipolar Disorder and may be more common in males than in females Mixed Episode 333
334 Mood DisordersCourseMixed Episodes can evolve from a Manic Episode or from a Major Depressive Episode or may arise de novo  For example  the diagnosis would be changed from Bipolar I Disorder  Most Recent Episode Manic  to Bipolar I Disorder  Most Recent Episode Mixed  for an individual with 3 weeks of manic symptoms followed by 1 week of both manic symptoms and depressive symptoms  Mixed episodes may last weeks to several months and may remit to a period with few or no symptoms or evolve into a Major Depressive Episode  It is far less common for a Mixed Episode to evolve into a Manic Episode Differential DiagnosisA Mixed Episode must be distinguished from a Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  The diagnosis is Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition  e g   multiple sclerosis  brain tumor  Cushing's syndrome   see p  366   This determination is based on the history  laboratory findings or physical examination  If it is judged that the mixed manic and depressive symptoms are not the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition  then the primary Mood Disorder is recorded on Axis I  e g   Bipolar I Disorder  and the general medical condition is recorded on Axis III  e g   myocardial infarction  A Substance-Induced Mood Disorder is distinguished from a Mixed Episode by the fact that a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance  see p  370  Symptoms like those seen in a Mixed Episode may be precipitated by use of a drug of abuse  e g   mixed manic and depressive symptoms that occur only in the context of intoxication with cocaine would be diagnosed as Cocaine-Induced Mood Disorder  With Mixed Features  With Onset During Intoxication   Symptoms like those seen in a Mixed Episode may also be precipitated by antidepressant treatment such as medication  electro- convulsive therapy  or light therapy  Such episodes are also diagnosed as Substance- Induced Mood Disorders  e g   Amitriptyline-Induced Mood Disorder  With Mixed Features  Electroconvulsive Therapy-Induced Mood Disorder  With Mixed Features  Major Depressive Episodes with prominent irritable mood and ManicEpi- sodes with prominent irritable mood may be difficult to distinguish from Mixed Episodes  This determination requires a careful clinical evaluation of the simultaneous presence of symptoms that are characteristic of both a full Manic Episode and a full Major Depressive Episode  except for duration  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and a Mixed Episode are both charac- terized by excessive activity  impulsive behavior  poor judgment  and denial of problems  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is distinguished from a Mixed Episode by its characteristic early onset  i e   before age 7 years   chronic rather than episodic course  lack of relatively clear onsets and offsets  and the absence of abnormally expansive or elevated mood or psychotic features  Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder also sometimes show depressive symptoms such as low self-esteem and frustration tolerance  If criteria are met for both  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder may be diagnosed in addition to the Mood Disorder 
Criteria for Mixed EpisodeA  The criteria are met both for a Manic Episode  see p  332  and for a Major Depressive Episode  see p  327   except for duration  nearly every day during at least a 1-week period B  Themooddisturbanceissufficientlyseveretocausemarkedimpairment in occupational functioning or in usual social activities or relationships with others  or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others  or there are psychotic features C  The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or other treatment  or a general medical condition  e g   hyperthyroidism  Note  Mixed-like episodes that are clearly caused by somatic antidepressant treatment  e g   medication  electroconvulsive therapy  light therapy  should not count toward a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder Hypomanic EpisodeEpisode FeaturesA Hypomanic Episode is defined as a distinct period during which there is an abnormally and persistently elevated  expansive  or irritable mood that lasts at least 4 days  Criterion A   This period of abnormal mood must be accompanied by at least three additional symptoms from a list that includes inflated self-esteem or grandiosity  nondelusional   decreased need for sleep  pressure of speech  flight of ideas  distract- ibility  increased involvement in goal-directed activities or psychomotor agitation  and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences  Criterion B   If the mood is irritable rather than elevated or expansive  at least four of the above symptoms must be present  This list of additional symptoms is identical to those that define a Manic Episode  see p  328  except that delusions or hallucinations cannot be present  The mood during a Hypomanic Episode must be clearly different from the individual's usual nondepressed mood  and there must be a clear change in functioning that is not characteristic of the individual's usual functioning  Criterion C   Because the changes in mood and functioning must be observable by others  Criterion D   the evaluation of this criterion will often require interviewing other informants  e g   family members   History from other informants is particularly important in the evaluation of adolescents  In contrast to a Manic Episode  a Hypomanic Episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalization  and there are no psychotic features  Criterion E   The change in functioning for some individuals may take the form of a marked increase in efficiency  accomplishments  or creativity  However  for others  hypomania can cause some social or occupational impairment The mood disturbance and other symptoms must not be due to the directHypomanic Episode 335

CourseA Hypomanic Episode typically begins suddenly  with a rapid escalation of symptoms within a day or two  Episodes may last for several weeks to months and are usually more abrupt in onset and briefer than Major Depressive Episodes  In many cases  the Hypomanic Episode may be preceded or followed by a Major Depressive Episode  Studies suggest that 5%-15% of individuals with hypomania will ultimately develop a Manic Episode Differential DiagnosisA Hypomanic Episode must be distinguished from a Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  The diagnosis is Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition  e g   multiple sclerosis  brain tumor  Cushing's syndrome   see p  366   This determination is based on the history  laboratory findings  or physical examination  If it is judged that the hypomanic symptoms are not the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition  then the primary Mood Disorder is recorded on Axis I  e g   Bipolar II Disorder  and the general medical condition is recorded on Axis III  e g   myocardial infarction  A Substance-Induced Mood Disorder is distinguished from a Hypomanic Episode by the fact that a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance  see p  370   Symptoms like those seen in a Hypomanic Episode may be precipitated by a drug of abuse  e g   hypomanic symptoms that occur only in the context of intoxication with cocaine would be diagnosed as Cocaine-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  With Onset During Intoxication   Symptoms like those seen in a Hypomanic Episode may also be precipitated by antidepressant treatment such as medication  electroconvulsive therapy  or light therapy  Such episodes are also diagnosed as Substance-Induced Mood Disorders  e g   Amitriptyline-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  Electroconvulsive Therapy-Induced MoodDisorder WithManicFeatures  Manic Episodes should be distinguished from Hypomanic Episodes  Although Manic Episodes and Hypomanic Episodes have identical lists of characteristic symptoms  the mood disturbance in Hypomanic Episodes is not sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalization  Some Hypomanic Episodes may evolve into full Manic Episodes Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and a Hypomanic Episode are both characterized by excessive activity  impulsive behavior  poor judgment  and denial of problems  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is distinguished from a Hypomanic Episode by its characteristic early onset  i e   before age 7 years   chronic rather than episodic course  lack of relatively clear onsets and offsets  and the absence of abnormally expansive or elevated mood A Hypomanic Episode must be distinguished from euthymia  particularly in individuals who have been chronically depressed and are unaccustomed to the experience of a nondepressed mood state Hypomanic Episode 337
338 Mood DisordersCriteria for Hypomanic EpisodeA  A distinct period of persistently elevated  expansive  or irritable mood  lasting throughout at least 4 days  that is clearly different from the usual nondepressed mood B  Duringtheperiodofmooddisturbance three ormore ofthefollowing symptoms have persisted  four if the mood is only irritable  and have been present to a significant degree  1  inflated self-esteem or grandiosity 2  decreased need for sleep  e g   feels rested after only 3 hours ofsleep  3  more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking 4  flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing 5  distractibility  i e   attention too easily drawn to unimportant orirrelevant externalstimuli  6  increase in goal-directed activity either socially  at work or school or sexually  or psychomotor agitation 7  excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a highpotential for painful consequences  e g   the person engages in unrestrained buying sprees  sexual indiscretions  or foolish busi- ness investments C  The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the person when not symptomatic D  The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others E  The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning  or to necessitate hospitalization  and there are no psychotic features F  The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or other treatment  or a general medical condition  e g   hyperthyroidism  Note  Hypomanic-like episodes that are clearly caused by somatic antidepressant treatment  e g   medication  electroconvulsive therapy  light therapy  should not count toward a diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder 
Major Depressive Disorder 339Depressive Disorder
Major Depressive DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Major Depressive Disorder is a clinical course that is character- ized by one or more Major Depressive Episodes  see p  320  without a history of Manic  Mixed  or Hypomanic Episodes  Criteria A and C   Episodes of Substance-Induced Mood Disorder  due to the direct physiological effects of a drug of abuse  a medication  or toxin exposure  or of Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition do not count toward a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder  In addition  the episodes must not be better accounted for by Schizoaffective Disorder and are not superimposed on Schizo- phrenia  Schizophreniform Disorder  Delusional Disorder  or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified CriterionB  The fourth digit in the diagnostic code for Major Depressive Disorder indicates whether it is a Single Episode  used only for first episodes  or Recurrent  It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between a single episode with waxing and waning symptoms and two separate episodes  For purposes of this manual  an episode is considered to have ended when the full criteria for the Major Depressive Episode have not been met for at least 2 consecutive months  During this 2-month period  there is either complete resolution of symptoms or the presence of depressive symptoms that no longer meet the full criteria for a Major Depressive Episode  In Partial Remission  The fifth digit in the diagnostic code for Major Depressive Disorder indicates the current state of the disturbance  If the criteria for a Major Depressive Episode are met  the severity of the episode is noted as Mild  Moderate  Severe Without PsychoticFeatures  or Severe With Psychotic Features  If the criteria for a Major Depressive Episode are not currently met  the fifth digit is used to indicate whether the disorder is In Partial Remission or In Full Remission  see p  377  If Manic  Mixed  or Hypomanic Episodes develop in the course of Major Depressive Disorder  the diagnosis is changed to a Bipolar Disorder  However  if manic or hypomanic symptoms occur as a direct effect of antidepressant treatment  use of other medications  substance use  or toxin exposure  the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder remains appropriate and an additional diagnosis of Substance-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  or With Mixed Features   should be noted  Similarly  if manic or hypomanic symptoms occur as a direct effect of a general medical condition  the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder remains appropriate and an additional diagnosis of Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  With Manic Features  or With Mixed Features   should be noted SpecifiersThe following specifiers may be used to describe the current Major Depressive Episode  or  if criteria are not currently met for a Major Depressive Episode  the most recent Major Depressive Episode  Mild  Moderate  Severe Without Psychotic Features  Severe With Psychotic Features  In Partial Remission  In Full Remission  see p  376

Associated laboratory findings  The laboratory abnormalities that are associated with Major Depressive Disorder are those associated with Major Depressive Episode  see p  323   None of these findings are diagnostic of Major Depressive Disorder  but they have been noted to be abnormal in groups of individualswith Major Depressive Disorder compared with control subjects  Most laboratory abnormalities are state dependent  i e   are present only when depressive symptoms are present   However  evidence suggests that some sleep EEG abnormalities persist into clinical remission or may precede the onset of the Major Depressive Episode Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions Major Depressive Disorder may be associated with chronic general medical conditions  Up to 20%-25% of individuals with certain general medical conditions  e g   diabetes  myocardial infarction  carcinomas  stroke  will develop Major Depressive Disorder during the course of their general medical condition  The management of the general medical condition is more complex and the prognosis is less favorable if Major Depressive Disorder is present Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesSpecific culture-related features are discussed in the text for Major Depressive Episode  see p  324   Major Depressive Disorder  Single or Recurrent  is twice as common in adolescent and adult females as in adolescent and adult males  In prepubertal children  boys and girls are equally affected  Rates in men and women are highest in the 25- to 44-year-old age group  whereas rates are lower for both men and women over age 65 years PrevalenceStudies of Major Depressive Disorder have reported a wide range of values for the proportion of the adult population with the disorder  The lifetime risk for Major Depressive Disorder in community samples has varied from 10%to 25%for women and from 5% to 12% for men  The point prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder in adults in community samples has varied from 5% to 9% for women and from 2% to 3% for men  The prevalence rates for Major Depressive Disorder appear to be unrelated to ethnicity  education  income  or marital status CourseMajor Depressive Disorder may begin at any age  with an average age at onset in the mid-20s  Epidemiological data suggest that the age at onset is decreasing for those born more recently  The course of Major Depressive Disorder  Recurrent  is variable  Some people have isolated episodes that are separated by many years without any depressive symptoms  whereas others have clusters of episodes  and still others have increasingly frequent episodes as they grow older  Some evidence suggests that the periods of remission generally last longer early in the course of the disorder  The number of prior episodes predicts the likelihood of developing a subsequent Major Depressive Episode  Approximately 50%-60% of individuals with Major Depressive Disorder  Single Episode  can be expected to have a second episode  Individuals who have had two episodesMajor Depressive Disorder 341
342 Mood Disordershave a 70% chance of having a third  and individuals who have had three episodes have a 90% chance of having a fourth  About 5%-10% of individuals with Major Depressive Disorder  Single Episode  subsequently develop a Manic Episode  i e   develop BipolarI Disorder  Major Depressive Episodes may end completely  in about two-thirds of cases   or only partially or not at all  in about one-third of cases   For individuals who have only partial remission  there is a greater likelihood of developing additional episodes and of continuing the pattern of partial interepisode recovery  The longitudinal course specifiers With Full Interepisode Recovery and Without Full Interepisode Recovery  see p  387  may therefore have prognostic value  A number of individuals have preexisting Dysthymic Disorder prior to the onset of Major Depressive Disorder  Single Episode  Some evidence suggests that these individuals are more likely to have additional Major Depressive Episodes  have poorer interepisode recovery  and may require additional acute-phasetreatmentandalongerperiod ofcontinuingtreatmenttoattainandmaintain a more thorough and longer-lasting euthymic state Follow-up naturalistic studies suggested that 1 year after the diagnosis of a Major Depressive Episode  40% of individuals still have symptoms that are sufficiently severe to meet criteria for a full Major Depressive Episode  roughly 20% continue to have some symptoms that no longer meet full criteria for a Major Depressive Episode  i e   Major Depressive Disorder  In PartialRemission   and 40% have no Mood Disorder  The severity of the initial Major Depressive Episode appears to predict persistence  Chronic general medical conditions are also a risk factor for more persistent episodes Episodes of Major Depressive Disorder often follow a severe psychosocial stressor  such as the death of a loved one or divorce  Studies suggest that psychosocial events  stressors  may play a more significant role in the precipitation of the first or second episodes of Major Depressive Disorder and may play less of a role in the onset of subsequent episodes  Chronic general medical conditions and Substance Dependence  particularly Alcohol or Cocaine Dependence  may contribute to the onset or exacerba- tion of Major Depressive Disorder It is difficult to predict whether the first episode of a Major Depressive Disorder in a young person will ultimately evolve into a Bipolar Disorder  Some data suggest that the acute onset of severe depression  especially with psychotic features and psychomotor retardation  in a young person without prepubertal psychopathology is more likely to predict a bipolar course  A family history of Bipolar Disorder may also be suggestive of subsequent development of Bipolar Disorder Familial PatternMajor Depressive Disorder is 1 5-3 times more common among first-degree biological relatives of persons with this disorder than among the general population  There is evidence for an increased risk of Alcohol Dependence in adult first-degree biological relatives  and there may be an increased incidence of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in the children of adults with this disorder Differential DiagnosisSee the "Differential Diagnosis" section for Major Depressive Episode  p  325   A history of a Manic  Mixed  or Hypomanic Episode precludes the diagnosis of Major
Depressive Disorder  The presence of Hypomanic Episodes  without any history of Manic Episodes  indicates a diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder  The presence of Manic or Mixed Episodes  with or without Hypomanic Episodes  indicates a diagnosis of BipolarI Disorder Major Depressive Episodes in Major Depressive Disorder must be distinguished from a Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  The diagnosis is Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition  e g   multiple sclerosis  stroke  hypothyroidism   see p  366   This determination is based on the history  laboratory findings  or physical examination  If it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition  then the primary Mood Disorder is recorded on Axis I  e g   Major Depressive Disorder  and the general medical condition is recorded on Axis III  e g   myocardial infarction   This would be the case  for example  if the Major Depressive Episode is considered to be the psychological consequence of having the general medical condition or if there is no etiological relationship between the Major Depressive Episode and the general medical condition A Substance-Induced Mood Disorder is distinguished from Major Depressive Episodes in Major Depressive Disorder by the fact that a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance  see p  370   For example  depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would be diagnosed as Cocaine-Induced Mood Disorder  With Depressive Features  With Onset DuringWithdrawal Dysthymic Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder are differentiated based on severity  chronicity  and persistence  In Major Depressive Disorder  the depressed mood must be present for most of the day  nearly every day  for a period of at least 2 weeks  whereas Dysthymic Disorder must be present for more days than not over a period of at least 2 years  The differential diagnosis between Dysthymic Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder is made particularly difficult by the fact that the two disorders share similar symptoms and that the differences between them in onset  duration  persistence  and severity are not easy to evaluate retrospectively  Usually Major Depressive Disorder consists of one or more discrete Major Depressive Episodes that can be distinguished from the person's usual functioning  whereas Dysthymic Disorder is characterized by chronic  less severe depressive symptoms that have been present for many years  If the initial onset of chronic depressive symptoms is of sufficient severity and number to meet criteria for a Major Depressive Episode  the diagnosis would be Major Depressive Disorder  Chronic  if the criteria are still met   or Major Depressive Disorder  In Partial Remission  if the criteria are no longer met   The diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder is made following Major Depressive Disorder only if the Dysthymic Disorder was estab- lished prior to the first Major Depressive Episode  i e   no Major Depressive Episodes during the first 2 years of dysthymic symptoms   or if there has been a full remission of the Major Depressive Episode  i e   lasting at least 2 months  before the onset of the Dysthymic Disorder Schizoaffective Disorder differs from Major Depressive Disorder  With Psychotic Features  by the requirement that in Schizoaffective Disorder there must be at least 2 weeks of delusions or hallucinations occurring in the absence of prominent mood symptoms  Depressive symptoms may be present during Schizophrenia  Delusional Disorder  and Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified  Most commonly  such depressive symptoms can be considered associated features of these disorders and doMajor Depressive Disorder 343

individuals with Dysthymic Disorder  vegetative symptoms  e g   sleep  appetite  weight change  and psychomotor symptoms  appear to be less common than for persons in a Major Depressive Episode  When Dysthymic Disorder without prior Major Depressive Disorder is present  it is a risk factor for developing Major Depressive Disorder  10% of individuals with Dysthymic Disorder will develop Major Depressive Disorder over the next year   Dysthymic Disorder may be associated with Borderline  Histrionic  Narcis- sistic  Avoidant  and Dependent Personality Disorders  However  the assessment of features of a Personality Disorder is difficult in such individuals because chronic mood symptoms may contribute to interpersonal problems or be associated with distorted self-perception  Other chronic Axis I disorders  e g   Substance Dependence  or chronic psychosocial stressors may be associated with Dysthymic Disorder in adults  In children  Dysthymic Disorder may be associated with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder  Conduct Disorder  Anxiety Disorders  Learning Disorders  and Mental Retardation Associated laboratory findings  About 25%-50% of adults with Dysthymic Disorder have some of the same polysomnographic features that are found in some individuals with Major Depressive Disorder  e g   reduced rapid eye movement  REM latency  increased REMdensity  reduced slow-wave sleep  impaired sleep continuity   Those individuals with polysomnographic abnormalities more often have a positive family history for Major Depressive Disorder  and may respond better to antidepressant medications  than those with Dysthymic Disorder without such findings  Whether polysomnographic abnormalities are also found in those with "pure" Dysthymic Disorder  i e   those with no prior history of Major Depressive Episodes  is not clear  Dexameth- asone nonsuppression in Dysthymic Disorder is not common  unless criteria are also met for a Major Depressive Episode Specific Age and Gender FeaturesIn children  Dysthymic Disorder seems to occur equally in both sexes and often results in impaired school performance and social interaction  Children and adolescents with Dysthymic Disorder are usually irritable and cranky as well as depressed  They have low self-esteem and poor social skills and are pessimistic  In adulthood  women are two to three times more likely to develop DysthymicDisorder than aremen PrevalenceThe lifetime prevalence of Dysthymic Disorder  with or without superimposed Major Depressive Disorder  is approximately 6%  The point prevalence of Dysthymic Disorder is approximately 3% CourseDysthymic Disorder often has an early and insidious onset  i e   in childhood  adoles- cence  or early adult life  as well as a chronic course  In clinical settings  individuals with Dysthymic Disorder usually have superimposed Major Depressive Disorder  which is often the reason for seeking treatment  If Dysthymic Disorder precedes the onset of Major Depressive Disorder  there is less likelihood that there will be spontaneous full interepisode recovery between Major Depressive Episodes and a greater likelihood of having more frequent subsequent episodes 300 4 Dysthymic Disorder 347
348 Mood DisordersFamilial PatternDysthymic Disorder is more common among first-degree biological relatives of people with Major Depressive Disorder than among the general population Differential DiagnosisSee the "Differential Diagnosis" section for Major Depressive Disorder  p  342  The differential diagnosis between Dysthymic Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder is made particularly difficult by the facts that the two disorders share similar symptoms and that the differences between them in onset  duration  persistence  and severity are not easy to evaluate retrospectively  Usually Major Depressive Disorder consists of one or more discrete Major Depressive Episodes that can be distinguished from the person's usual functioning  whereas Dysthymic Disorder is characterized by chronic  less severe depressive symptoms that have been present for many years  When Dysthymic Disorder is of many years' duration  the mood disturbance may not be easily distinguished from the person's "usual" functioning  If the initial onset of chronic depressive symptoms is of sufficient severity and number to meet full criteria for a Major Depressive Episode  the diagnosis would be Major Depressive Disorder  Chronic  if the full criteria are still met   or Major Depressive Disorder  In Partial Remission  if the full criteria are no longer met   The diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder can be made following Major Depressive Disorder only if the Dysthymic Disorder was established prior to the first Major Depressive Episode  i e   no Major Depressive Episodes during the first 2 years of dysthymic symptoms   or if there has been a full remission of the Major Depressive Disorder  i e   lasting at least 2 months  before the onset of the Dysthymic Disorder Depressive symptoms may be a common associated feature of chronic Psychotic Disorders  e g   Schizoaffective Disorder  Schizophrenia  Delusional Disorder   A sep- arate diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder is not made if the symptoms occur only during the course of the Psychotic Disorder  including residual phases  Dysthymic Disorder must be distinguished from a Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  The diagnosis is Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  With Depressive Features  if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific  usually chronic  general medical condition  e g   multiple sclerosis   see p  366   This determination is based on the history  laboratory findings  or physical examination  If it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition  then the primary Mood Disorder is recorded on Axis I  e g   DysthymicDisorder  and the general medical condition is recorded on Axis III  e g   diabetes mellitus   This would be the case  for example  if the depressive symptoms are considered to be the psychological conse- quence of having a chronic general medical condition or if there is no etiological relationship between the depressive symptoms and the general medical condition  A Substance-Induced Mood Disorder is distinguished from a Dysthymic Disorder by the fact that a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance  see p 370  Often there is evidence of a coexisting personality disturbance  When an individual's presentation meets the criteria for both Dysthymic Disorder and a Personality Disorder  both diagnoses are given 
300 4 Dysthymic Disorder 349 I Diagnostic criteria for 300 4 Dysthymic DisorderA  Depressed mood for most of the day  for more days than not  as indicated either by subjective account or observation by others  for at least 2 years  Note  In children and adolescents  mood can be irritable and duration must be at least 1 year B  Presence  while depressed  of two  or more  of the following  1  poor appetite or overeating 2  insomnia or hypersomnia 3  low energy or fatigue 4  low self-esteem 5  poor concentration or difficulty making decisions 6  feelings of hopelessnessC  During the 2-year period  1 year for children or adolescents  of the disturbance  the person has never been without the symptoms in Criteria A and B for more than 2 months at a time D  No Major Depressive Episode  see p  327  has been present during the first 2 years of the disturbance  1 year for children and adolescents   i e   the disturbance is not better accounted for by chronic Major Depressive Disorder  or Major Depressive Disorder  In Partial Remission Note  There may have been a previous Major Depressive Episode provided there was a full remission  no significant signs or symptoms for 2 months  before development of the Dysthymic Disorder  In addition  after the initial 2 years  1 year in children or adolescents  of Dysthymic Disorder  there may be superimposed episodes of Major Depressive Disorder  in which case both diagnoses may be given when the criteria are met for a Major Depressive Episode E  There has never been a Manic Episode  see p  332   a Mixed Episode  see p  335   or a Hypomanic Episode  see p  338   and criteria have never been met for Cyclothymic Disorder F  The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a chronic Psychotic Disorder  such as Schizophrenia or Delusional Disorder G  The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition  e g   hypothyroidism  H  The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning Specify if Early Onset  if onset is before age 21 years Late Onset  if onset is age 21 years or olderSpecify  for most recent 2 years of Dysthymic Disorder  With Atypical Features  see p  384 
350 Mood Disorders311 Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise SpecifiedThe Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified category includes disorders with depressive features that do not meet the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder  Dysthymic Disorder  Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood  see p  623   or Adjustment Disorder With Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood  see p  624   Sometimes depressive symptoms can present as part of an Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified  see p  444   Examples of Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified include1  Premenstrual dysphoric disorder  in most menstrual cycles during the past year  symptoms  e g   markedly depressed mood  marked anxiety  marked affective lability  decreased interest in activities  regularly occurred during the last week of the luteal phase  and remitted within a few days of the onset of menses   These symptoms must be severe enough to markedly interfere with work  school  or usual activities and be entirely absent for at least 1 week postmenses  see p  715 for suggested research criteria  2  Minor depressive disorder  episodes of at least 2 weeks of depressive symptoms but with fewer than the five items required for Major Depressive Disorder  see p  719 for suggested research criteria  3  Recurrent brief depressive disorder  depressive episodes lasting from 2 days up to 2 weeks  occurring at least once a month for 12 months  not associated with the menstrual cycle   see p  721 for suggested research criteria  4  Postpsychotic depressive disorder of Schizophrenia  a Major Depressive Episode that occurs during the residual phase of Schizophrenia  see p  711 for suggested research criteria  5  A Major Depressive Episode superimposed on Delusional Disorder  Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified  or the active phase of Schizophrenia 6  Situations in which the clinician has concluded that a depressive disorder is present but is unable to determine whether it is primary  due to a general medical condition  or substance induced Bipolar DisordersThis section includes Bipolar I Disorder  Bipolar II Disorder  Cyclothymia  and Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified  There are six separate criteria sets for Bipolar I Disorder  Single Manic Episode  Most Recent Episode Hypomanic  Most Recent Episode Manic  Most Recent Episode Mixed  Most Recent Episode Depressed  and Most Recent Episode Unspecified  Bipolar I Disorder  Single Manic Episode  is used to describe individuals who are having a first episode of mania  The remaining criteria sets are used to specify the nature of the current  or most recent  episode in individuals who have had recurrent mood episodes 
Bipolar I DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Bipolar I Disorder is a clinical course that is characterized by the occurrence of one or more Manic Episodes  see p  328  or Mixed Episodes  see
p  333   Often individuals have also had one or more Major Depressive Episodes  see p  320   Episodes of Substance-Induced Mood Disorder  due to the direct effects of a medication  other somatic treatments for depression  a drug of abuse  or toxin exposure  or of Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition do not count toward a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder  In addition  the episodes are not better accounted for by Schizoaffective Disorder and are not superimposed on Schizophrenia  Schizophreniform Disorder  Delusional Disorder  or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified  Bipolar I Disorder is subclassified in the fourth digit of the code according to whether the individual is experiencing a first episode  i e   Single Manic Episode  or whether the disorder is recurrent  Recurrence is indicated by either a shift in the polarity of the episode or an interval between episodes of at least 2 months without manic symptoms  A shift in polarity is defined as a clinical course in which a Major Depressive Episode evolves into a Manic Episode or a Mixed Episode or in which a Manic Episode or a Mixed Episode evolves into a Major Depressive Episode  In contrast  a Hypomanic Episode that evolves into a Manic Episode or a Mixed Episode  or a Manic Episode that evolves into a Mixed Episode  or vice versa   is considered to be only a single episode  For recurrent Bipolar I Disorders  the nature of the current  or most recent  episode can be specified  Most Recent Episode Hypomanic  Most Recent Episode Manic  Most Recent Episode Mixed  Most Recent Episode Depressed  Most Recent Episode Unspecified  SpecifiersThe following specifiers for Bipolar I Disorder can be used to describe the current Manic  Mixed  or Major Depressive Episode  or  if criteria are not currently met for a Manic  Mixed  or Major Depressive Episode  the most recent Manic  Mixed  or Major Depressive Episode  Mild  Moderate  Severe Without Psychotic Features  Severe With Psychotic Features  In Partial Remission  In Full Remission  see p  376 With Catatonic Features  see p  382  With Postpartum Onset  see p  386 The following specifiers apply only to the current  or most recent  Major Depressive Episode only if it is the most recent type of mood episode Chronic  see p  382 With Melancholic Features  see p  383  With Atypical Features  see p  384 The following specifiers can be used to indicate the pattern of episodes Longitudinal Course Specifiers  With or Without Full Interepisode Recovery   see p  387 With Seasonal Pattern  applies only to the pattern of Major Depressive Episodes   see p  389 With Rapid Cycling  see p  390 Recording ProceduresThe diagnostic codes for Bipolar I Disorder are selected as follows  1  The first three digits are 296 Bipolar I Disorder 351
352Mood Disorders2 3 The fourth digit is 0 if there is a single Manic Episode  For recurrent episodes  the fourth digit is 4 if the current or most recent episode is a Hypomanic Episode or a Manic Episode  6 if it is a Mixed Episode  5 if it is a Major Depressive Episode  and 7 if the current or most recent episode is Unspecified The fifth digit  except for Bipolar I Disorder  Most Recent Episode Hypomanic  and Bipolar I Disorder  Most Recent Episode Unspecified  indicates the follow- ing  1 for Mild severity  2 for Moderate severity  3 for Severe Without Psychotic Features  4 for Severe With Psychotic Features  5 for In Partial Remission  6 for In Full Remission  and 0 if Unspecified  Other specifiers for Bipolar I Disorder cannot be coded  For Bipolar I Disorder  Most Recent Episode Hypomanic  the fifth digit is always 0  For Bipolar Disorder  Most Recent Episode Unspecified  there is no fifth digit In recording the name of a diagnosis  terms should be listed in the following order  Bipolar I Disorder  specifiers coded in the fourth digit  e g   Most Recent Episode Manic   specifiers coded in the fifth digit  e g   Mild  Severe With Psychotic Features  In Partial Remission   as many specifiers  without codes  as apply to the most recent episode  e g   With Melancholic Features  With Postpartum Onset   and as many specifiers  without codes  as apply to the course of episodes  e g   With Rapid Cycling  for example  296 54 Bipolar I Disorder  Most Recent Episode Depressed  Severe With Psychotic Features  With Melancholic Features  With Rapid Cycling Note that if the single episode of Bipolar I Disorder is a Mixed Episode  the diagnosis would be indicated as 296 Ox Bipolar I Disorder  Single Manic Episode  Mixed Associated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Completed suicide occurs in 10%-15% of individuals with Bipolar I Disorder  Child abuse  spouse abuse  or other violent behavior may occur during severe ManicEpisodes or during those with psychotic features  Other associated problems include school truancy  school failure  occupational failure  divorce  or episodic antisocial behavior  Other associated mental disorders include Anorexia Nervosa  Bulimia Nervosa  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder  Panic Disorder  Social Phobia  Substance-Related Disorders Associated laboratory findings  There appear to be no laboratory features that distinguish Major Depressive Episodes found in Major Depressive Disorder from those in Bipolar I Disorder Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions An age at onset for a first Manic Episode after age 40 years should alert the clinician to the possibility that the symptoms may be due to a general medical condition or substance use  There is some evidence that untreated thyroid disease worsens the prognosis of Bipolar I Disorder Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesThere are no reports of differential incidence of Bipolar I Disorder based on race or ethnicity  There is some evidence that clinicians may have a tendency to overdiagnose
Schizophrenia  instead of Bipolar Disorder  in some ethnic groups and in younger individuals Approximately 10%-15% of adolescents with recurrent Major Depressive Episodes will go on to develop Bipolar I Disorder  Mixed Episodes appear to be more likely in adolescents and young adults than in older adults Recent epidemiological studies in the United States indicate that Bipolar I Disorder is approximately equally common in men and women  unlike Major Depressive Disorder  which is more common in women   Gender appears to be related to the order of appearance of Manic and Major Depressive Episodes  The first episode in males is more likely to be a Manic Episode  The first episode in females is more likely to be a Major Depressive Episode  Women with Bipolar I Disorder have an increased risk of developing subsequent episodes  often psychotic  in the immediate postpartum period  Some women have their first episode during the postpartum period  The specifier With Postpartum Onset may be used to indicate that the onset of the episode is within 4 weeks of delivery  see p  386   The premenstrual period may be associated with worsening of an ongoing Major Depressive  Manic  Mixed  or Hypomanic Episode PrevalenceThe lifetime prevalence of Bipolar I Disorder in community samples has varied from 0 4% to 1 6% CourseBipolar I Disorder is a recurrent disorderâ€”more than 90% of individuals who have a single Manic Episode go on to have future episodes  Roughly 60%-70% of Manic Episodes occur immediately before or after a Major Depressive Episode  Manic Episodes often precede or follow the Major Depressive Episodes in a characteristic pattern for a particular person  The number of lifetime episodes  both Manic and Major Depressive  tends to be higher for Bipolar I Disorder compared with Major Depressive Disorder  Recurrent  Studies of the course of Bipolar I Disorder prior to lithium maintenance treatment suggest that  on average  four episodes occur in 10years  The interval between episodes tends to decrease as the individual ages  There is some evidence that changes in sleep-wake schedule such as occur during time zone changes or sleep deprivation may precipitate or exacerbate a Manic  Mixed  or Hypomanic Episode  Approximately 5%-15% of individuals with Bipolar I Disorder have multiple  four or more  mood episodes  Major Depressive  Manic  Mixed  or Hypomanic  that occur within a given year  If this pattern is present  it is noted by the specifier With Rapid Cycling  see p  390   A rapid-cycling pattern is associated with a poorer prognosis Although the majority of individuals with Bipolar I Disorder return to a fully functional level between episodes  some  20%-30%  continue to display mood lability and interpersonal or occupational difficulties  Psychotic symptoms may develop after days or weeks in what was previously a nonpsychotic Manic or Mixed Episode  When an individual has Manic Episodes with psychotic features  subsequent Manic Episodes are more likely to have psychotic features  Incomplete interepisode recovery is more common when the current episode is accompanied by mood-incongruent psychotic features Bipolar I Disorder 353
354 Mood DisordersFamilial PatternFirst-degree biological relatives of individuals with Bipolar I Disorder have elevated rates of Bipolar I Disorder  4%-24%   Bipolar II Disorder  l%-5%   and Major Depressive Disorder  4%-24%   Twin and adoption studies provide strong evidence of a genetic influence for Bipolar I Disorder Differential DiagnosisMajor Depressive  Manic  Mixed  and Hypomanic Episodes in Bipolar I Disorder must be distinguished from episodes of a Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  The diagnosis is Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition for episodes that are judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition  e g   multiple sclerosis  stroke  hypothyroidism   see p  366  This determination is based on the history  laboratory findings  or physical examination A Substance-Induced Mood Disorder is distinguished from Major Depressive  Manic  or Mixed Episodes that occur in Bipolar I Disorder by the fact that a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance  see p  370   Symptoms like those seen in a Manic  Mixed  or Hypomanic Episode may be part of an intoxication with or withdrawal from a drug of abuse and should be diagnosed as a Substance-Induced Mood Disorder  e g   euphoric mood that occurs only in the context of intoxication with cocaine would be diagnosed as Cocaine-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  With Onset During Intoxication   Symptoms like those seen in a Manic or Mixed Episode may also be precipitated by antidepressant treatment such as medication  electroconvulsive therapy  or light therapy  Such episodes may be diagnosed as a Substance-Induced Mood Disorder  e g   Amitriptyline-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  Electroconvulsive Therapy-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  and would not count toward a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder  However  when the substance use or medication is judged not to fully account for the episode  e g   the episode continues for a considerable period autonomously after the substance is discontinued   the episode would count toward a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder Bipolar I Disorder is distinguished from Major Depressive Disorder and Dysthy- mic Disorder by the lifetime history of at least one Manic or Mixed Episode  Bipolar I Disorder is distinguished from Bipolar II Disorder by the presence of one or more Manic or Mixed Episodes  When an individual previously diagnosed with Bipolar II Disorder develops a Manic or Mixed Episode  the diagnosis is changed to Bipolar I Disorder In Cyclothymic Disorder  there are numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a Manic Episode and periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet symptom or duration criteria for a Major Depressive Episode  Bipolar I Disorder is distinguished from Cyclothymic Disorder by the presence of one or more Manic or Mixed Episodes  If a Manic or Mixed Episode occurs after the first 2 years of Cyclothymic Disorder  then Cyclothymic Disorder and Bipolar I Disorder may both be diagnosed The differential diagnosis between Psychotic Disorders  e g   Schizoaffective Disorder  Schizophrenia  and Delusional Disorder  and Bipolar I Disorder may be difficult  especially in adolescents  because these disorders may share a number of presenting symptoms  e g   grandiose and persecutory delusions  irritability  agitation 
and catatonic symptoms   particularly cross-sectionally and early in their course  In contrast to Bipolar I Disorder  Schizophrenia  Schizoaffective Disorder  and Delusional Disorder are all characterized by periods of psychotic symptoms that occur in the absence of prominent mood symptoms  Other helpful considerations include the accompanying symptoms  previous course  and family history  Manic and depressive symptoms may be present during Schizophrenia  Delusional Disorder  and Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified  but rarely with sufficient number  duration  and pervasiveness to meet criteria for a Manic Episode or a Major Depressive Episode  However  when full criteria are met  or the symptoms are of particular clinical significance   a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified may be made in addition to the diagnosis of Schizophrenia  Delusional Disorder  or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified If there is a very rapid alternation  over days  between manic symptoms and depressive symptoms  e g   several days of purely manic symptoms followed by several days of purely depressive symptoms  that do not meet minimal duration criteria for a Manic Episode or Major Depressive Episode  the diagnosis is Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified I Diagnostic criteria for 296 Ox Bipolar I Disorder  Single Manic EpisodeA  Presence of only one Manic Episode  see p  332  and no past Major Depressive Episodes Note  Recurrence is defined as either a change in polarity from depression or an interval of at least 2 months without manic symptoms B  The Manic Episode is not better accounted for by Schizoaffective Disorder and is not superimposed on Schizophrenia  Schizophreniform Disorder  Delusional Disorder  or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified Specify if Mixed  if symptoms meet criteria for a Mixed Episode  see p  335 Specify  for current or most recent episode  Severity/Psychotic/Remission Specifiers  see p  378  With Catatonic Features  see p  382 With Postpartum Onset  see p  386 Bipolar I Disorder 355

the Major Depressive Episodes in a characteristic pattern for a particular person  The number of lifetime episodes  both Hypomanic Episodes and Major Depressive Episodes  tends to be higher for Bipolar II Disorder compared with Major Depressive Disorder  Recurrent  The interval between episodes tends to decrease as the individual ages  Approximately 5%-15% of individuals with Bipolar II Disorder have multiple  four or more  mood episodes  Hypomanic or Major Depressive  that occur within a given year  If this pattern is present  it is noted by the specifier With Rapid Cycling  see p  390   A rapid-cycling pattern is associated with a poorer prognosis Although the majority of individuals with Bipolar II Disorder return to a fully functional level between episodes  approximately 15% continue to display mood lability and interpersonal or occupational difficulties  Psychotic symptoms do not occur in Hypomanic Episodes  and they appear to be less frequent in the Major Depressive Episodes in Bipolar II Disorder than is the case for Bipolar I Disorder  Some evidence is consistent with the notion that marked changes in sleep-wake schedule such as occur during time zone changes or sleep deprivation may precipitate or exacerbate Hypomanic or Major Depressive Episodes  If a Manic or Mixed Episode develops in the course of Bipolar II Disorder  the diagnosis is changed to Bipolar I Disorder  Over 5 years  about 5%-15% of individuals with Bipolar II Disorder will develop a Manic Episode Familial PatternSome studies have indicated that first-degree biological relatives of individuals with Bipolar II Disorder have elevated rates of Bipolar II Disorder  Bipolar I Disorder  and Major Depressive Disorder compared with the general population Differential DiagnosisHypomanic and Major Depressive Episodes in Bipolar II Disorder must be distinguished from episodes of a Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  The diagnosis is Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition for episodes that are judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition  e g   multiple sclerosis  stroke  hypothyroidism   see p  366   This determination is based on the history  laboratory findings  or physicalexamination A Substance-Induced Mood Disorder is distinguished from Hypomanic or Major Depressive Episodes that occur in Bipolar II Disorder by the fact that a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance  see p  370   Symptoms like those seen in a Hypomanic Episode may be part of an intoxication with or withdrawal from a drug of abuse and should be diagnosed as a Substance-Induced Mood Disorder  e g   a major depressive-like episode occurring only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would be diagnosed as Cocaine-Induced Mood Disorder  With Depressive Features  With Onset During With- drawal   Symptoms like those seen in a Hypomanic Episode may also be precipitated by antidepressant treatment such as medication  electroconvulsive therapy  or light therapy  Such episodes may be diagnosed as a Substance-Induced Mood Disorder  e g   Amitriptyline-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  ElectroconvulsiveTherapy- Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  and would not count toward a diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder  However  when the substance use or medication is judged not to fully account for the episode  e g   the episode continues for a considerable period296 89 Bipolar II Disorder 361

301 13 Cyclothymic DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Cyclothymic Disorder is a chronic  fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms  see p  335  and numerous periods of depressive symptoms  see p  320   Criterion A   The hypomanic symptoms are of insufficient number  severity  pervasiveness  or duration to meet full criteria for a Manic Episode  and the depressive symptoms are of insufficient number  severity  pervasive- ness  or duration to meet full criteria for a Major Depressive Episode  During the 2-year period  1 year for children or adolescents   any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months  Criterion B   The diagnosis of Cyclothymic Disorder is made only if the initial 2-year period of Cyclothymicsymptoms is free of Major Depressive  Manic  and Mixed Episodes  Criterion C   After the initial 2 years of the Cyclothymic Disorder  Manic or Mixed Episodes may be superimposed on the Cyclothymic Disorder  in which case both Cyclothymic Disorder and Bipolar I Disorder are diagnosed  Similarly  after the initial 2 years of Cyclothymic Disorder  Major Depressive Episodes may be superimposed on the Cyclothymic Disorder  in which case both Cyclothymic Disorder and Bipolar II Disorder are diagnosed  The diagnosis is not made if the pattern of mood swings is better accounted for by Schizoaffective Disorder or is superimposed on a Psychotic Disorder  such as Schizophrenia  Schizophreniform Disorder  Delusional Disorder  or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified  Criterion D   in which case the mood symptoms are considered to be associated features of the Psychotic Disorder  The mood disturbance must also not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition  e g   hyperthyroidism   Criterion E   Although some people may function particularlywell during some of the
364 Mood Disordersperiods of hypomania  overall there must be clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning as a result of the mood disturbance  Criterion F   The impairment may develop as a result of prolonged periods of cyclical  often unpredictable mood changes  e g   the person may be regarded as temperamental  moody  unpredictable  inconsistent  or unreliable  Associated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Substance-Related Disor- ders and Sleep Disorders  i e   difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep  may be present Specific Age and Gender FeaturesCyclothymic Disorder often begins early in life and is sometimes considered to reflect a temperamental predisposition to other Mood Disorders  especially Bipolar Disorders   In community samples  Cyclothymic Disorder is apparently equally common in men and in women  In clinical settings  women with Cyclothymic Disorder may be more likely to present for treatment than men PrevalenceStudies have reported a lifetime prevalence of Cyclothymic Disorder of from 0 4%to 1%  Prevalence in mood disorders clinics may range from 3% to 5% CourseCyclothymic Disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult life  Onset of Cyclothymic Disorder late in adult life may suggest a Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition such as multiple sclerosis  Cyclothymic Disorder usually has an insidious onset and a chronic course  There is a 15%-50% risk that the person will subsequently develop Bipolar I or II Disorder Familial PatternMajor Depressive Disorder and Bipolar I or II Disorder appear to be more common among first-degree biological relatives of persons with Cyclothymic Disorder than among the general population  There may also be an increased familial risk of Substance-Related Disorders Differential DiagnosisCyclothymic Disorder must be distinguished from a Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  The diagnosis is Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  With Mixed Features  when the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific  usually chronic general medical condition  e g   hyperthyroidism   see p  366   This determination is based on the history  laboratory findings  or physical examination  If it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not

293 83 Mood DisorderDue to a General Medical ConditionDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition is a prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition  The mood disturbance may involve depressed mood  markedly diminished interest or pleasure  or elevated  expansive  or irritable mood  Criterion A   Although the clinical presentation of the mood disturbance may resemble that of a Major Depressive  Manic  Mixed  or Hypomanic Episode  the full criteria for one of these episodes need not be met  the predominant symptom type may

Substance-Induced Mood DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Substance-Induced Mood Disorder is a prominent and persistent disturbance in mood  Criterion A  that is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  i e   a drug of abuse  a medication  other somatic treatment for depression  or toxin exposure   Criterion B   Depending on the nature of the substance and the context in which the symptoms occur  i e   during intoxication or withdrawal   the disturbance may involve depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure or elevated  expansive  or irritable mood  Although the clinical presentation of the mood disturbance may resemble that of a Major Depressive  Manic  Mixed  or Hypomanic Episode  the full criteria for one of these episodes need not be met  The predominant symptom type may be indicated by using one of the following subtypes  With Depressive Features  With Manic Features  With Mixed Features  The disturbance must not be better accounted for by a Mood Disorder that is not substance induced
Substance-Induced Mood Disorder 371 Criterion C   The diagnosis is not made if the mood disturbance occurs only during the course of a delirium  Criterion D   The symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Crite- rion E   In some cases  the individual may still be able to function  but only with markedly increased effort  This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of Substance Intoxication or Substance Withdrawal only when the mood symptoms are in excess of those usually associated with the intoxication or withdrawal syndrome and when the mood symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention A Substance-Induced Mood Disorder is distinguished from a primary Mood Disorder by considering the onset  course  and other factors  For drugs of abuse  there must be evidence from the history  physical examination  or laboratory findings of intoxication or withdrawal  Substance-Induced Mood Disorders arise only in association with intoxication or withdrawal states  whereas primary Mood Disorders may precede the onset of substance use or may occur during times of sustained abstinence  Because the withdrawal state for some substances can be relatively protracted  the onset of the mood symptoms can occur up to 4 weeks after the cessation of substance use  Another consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of primary Mood Disorders  e g   atypical age at onset or course   For example  the onset of a Manic Episode after age 45 years may suggest a substance-induced etiology  In contrast  factors that suggest that the mood symptoms are better accounted for by a primary Mood Disorder include persistence of mood symptoms for a substantial period of time  i e   about a month  after the end of Substance Intoxication or acute Substance Withdrawal the development of mood symptoms that are substantially in excess of what would be expected given the type or amount of the substance used or the duration of use  or a history of prior recurrent primary episodes of Mood Disorder Some medications  e g   stimulants  steroids  L-dopa  antidepressants  or other somatic treatments for depression  e g   electroconvulsive therapy or light therapy  can induce manic-like mood disturbances  Clinical judgment is essential to determine whether the treatment is truly causal or whether a primary Mood Disorder happened to have its onset while the person was receiving the treatment  For example  manic symptoms that develop in a person while he or she is taking lithium would not be diagnosed as Substance-Induced Mood Disorder because lithium is not likely to induce manic-like episodes  On the other hand  a depressive episode that developed within the first several weeks of beginning alpha-methyldopa  an antihypertensive agent  in a person with no history of Mood Disorder would qualify for the diagnosis of alpha- Methyldopa-Induced Mood Disorder  With Depressive Features  In some cases  a previously established condition  e g   Major Depressive Disorder  Recurrent  can recur while the person is coincidentally taking a medication that has the capacity to cause depressive symptoms  e g   L-dopa  birth-control pills   In such cases  the clinician must make a judgment as to whether the medication is causative in this particular situation  For a more detailed discussion of Substance-Related Disorders  see p  175 Subtypes and SpecifiersOne of the following subtypes may be used to indicate which of the following symptom presentations predominates With Depressive Features  This subtype is used if the predominant mood is depressed 
372 Mood DisordersWith Manic Features  This subtype is used if the predominant mood is elevated  euphoric  or irritable With Mixed Features  This subtype is used if the symptoms of both mania and depression are present but neither predominates The context of the development of the mood symptoms may be indicated by using one of the following specifiers With Onset During Intoxication  This specifier should be used if criteria for intoxication with the substance are met and the symptoms develop during the intoxication syndrome With Onset During Withdrawal  This specifier should be used if criteria for withdrawal from the substance are met and the symptoms develop during  or shortly after  a withdrawal syndrome Recording ProceduresThe name of the Substance-Induced Mood Disorder begins with the specific substance or somatic treatment  e g   cocaine  amitriptyline  electroconvulsive therapy  that is presumed to be causing the mood symptoms  The diagnostic code is selected from the listing of classes of substances provided in the criteria set  For substances that do not fit into any of the classes  e g   amitriptyline  and for other somatic treatments  e g   electroconvulsive therapy   the code for "Other Substance" should be used  In addition  for medications prescribed at therapeutic doses  the specific medication can be indicated by listing the appropriate E-code  see Appendix G   The name of the disorder  e g   Cocaine-Induced Mood Disorder  is followed by the subtype indicating the predominant symptom presentation and the specifier indicating the context in which the symptoms developed  e g   292 84 Cocaine-Induced Mood Disorder  With Depressive Features  With Onset During Withdrawal   When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of mood symptoms  each should be listed separately  e g   292 84 Cocaine-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features  With Onset During Withdrawal  292 84 Light Therapy-Induced Mood Disorder  With Manic Features   If a substance is judged to be the etiological factor but the specific substance or class of substances is unknown  the category 292 84 Unknown Substance-Induced Mood Disorder may be used Specific SubstancesMood Disorders can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances  alcohol  amphetamine and related substances  cocaine  hallucinogens  inhalants  opioids  phencyclidine and related substances  sedatives  hypnotics  and anxiolytics  and other or unknown substances  Mood Disorders can occur in association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances  alcohol  amphetamine and related substances  cocaine  sedatives  hypnotics  and anxiolytics  and other or unknown substances Some of the medications reported to evoke mood symptoms include anesthetics  analgesics  anticholinergics  anticonvulsants  antihypertensives  antiparkinsonian medi- cations  antiulcer medications  cardiac medications  oral contraceptives  psychotropic medications  e g   antidepressants  benzodiazepines  antipsychotics  disulfiram   muscle

394 Anxiety DisordersAnxiety Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition is characterized by prominent symptoms of anxiety that are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder is characterized by prominent symptoms of anxiety that are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a drug of abuse  a medication  or toxin exposure Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified is included for coding disorders with prominent anxiety or phobic avoidance that do not meet criteria for any of the specific Anxiety Disorders defined in this section  or anxiety symptoms about which there is inadequate or contradictoryinformation  Because Separation Anxiety Disorder  characterized by anxiety related to separation from parental figures  usually develops in childhood  it is included in the "Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy  Childhood  or Adolescence" section  see p  110   Phobic avoidance that is limited to genital sexual contact with a sexual partner is classified as Sexual Aversion Disorder and is included in the "Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders" section  see p  499  Panic AttackFeaturesBecause Panic Attacks occur in the context of several different Anxiety Disorders  the text and criteria set for a Panic Attack are provided separately in this section  The essential feature of a Panic Attack is a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort that is accompanied by at least 4 of 13 somatic or cognitive symptoms  The attack has a sudden onset and builds to a peak rapidly  usually in 10 minutes or less  and is often accompanied by a sense of imminent danger or impending doom and an urge to escape  The 13 somatic or cognitive symptoms are palpitations  sweating  trembling or shaking  sensations of shortness of breath or smothering  feeling of choking  chest pain or discomfort  nausea or abdominal distress  dizziness or lightheadedness  derealization or depersonalization  fear of losing control or "going crazy " fear of dying  paresthesias  and chills or hot flushes  Attacks that meet all other criteria but that have fewer than 4 somatic or cognitive symptoms are referred to as limited-symptom attacks Individuals seeking care for unexpected Panic Attacks will usually describe the fear as intense and report that they thought they were about to die  lose control  have a heart attack or stroke  or "go crazy " They also usually report an urgent desire to flee from wherever the attack is occurring  With recurrent attacks  some of the intense fearfulness may wane  Shortness of breath is a common symptom in Panic Attacks associated with Panic Disorder With and Without Agoraphobia  Blushing is common in situationally bound Panic Attacks related to social or performance anxiety  The anxiety that is characteristic of a Panic Attack can be differentiated from generalized anxiety by its intermittent  almost paroxysmal nature and its typically greater severity Panic Attacks can occur in a variety of Anxiety Disorders  e g   Panic Disorder  Social Phobia  Specific Phobia  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  Acute Stress Disorder   In determining the differential diagnostic significance of a Panic Attack  it is important to consider the context in which the Panic Attack occurs  There are three characteristic types of Panic Attacks with different relationships between the onset of the attack and the presence or absence of situational triggers  unexpected  uncued  Panic Attacks 
in which the onset of the Panic Attack is not associated with a situational trigger  i e   occurring spontaneously "out of the blue"   situationally bound  cued  Panic Attacks  in which the Panic Attack almost invariably occurs immediately on exposure to  or in anticipation of  the situational cue or trigger  e g   seeing a snake or dog always triggers an immediate Panic Attack   and situationally predisposed Panic Attacks  which are more likely to occur on exposure to the situational cue or trigger  but are not invariably associated with the cue and do not necessarily occur immediately after the exposure  e g   attacks are more likely to occur while driving  but there are times when the individual drives and does not have a Panic Attack or times when the Panic Attack occurs after driving for a half hour  The occurrence of unexpected Panic Attacks is required for a diagnosis of Panic Disorder  with or without Agoraphobia   Situationally bound Panic Attacks are most characteristic of Social and Specific Phobias  Situationally predisposed Panic Attacks are especially frequent in Panic Disorder but may at times occur in Specific Phobia or Social Phobia  The differential diagnosis of Panic Attacks is complicated by the fact that an exclusive relationship does not always exist between the diagnosis and the type ofPanic Attack  For instance  although Panic Disorder definitionally requires that at least some of the Panic Attacks be unexpected  individuals with Panic Disorder frequently report having situationally bound attacks  particularly later in the course of the disorder  The diagnostic issues for boundary cases are discussed in the "Differential Diagnosis" sections of the texts for the disorders in which Panic Attacks may appear Criteria for Panic AttackNote  A Panic Attack is not a codable disorder  Code the specific diagnosis in which the Panic Attack occurs  e g   300 21 Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia [p  402]  A discrete period of intense fear or discomfort  in which four  or more  of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes  1  palpitations  pounding heart  or accelerated heart rate 2  sweating 3  trembling or shaking 4  sensations of shortness of breath or smothering 5  feeling of choking 6  chest pain or discomfort 7  nausea or abdominal distress 8  feeling dizzy  unsteady  lightheaded  or faint 9  derealization  feelings of unreality  or depersonalization being detached from oneself  10  fear of losing control or going crazy 11  fear of dying 12  paresthesias  numbness or tingling sensations  13  chills or hot flushesPanic Attack 395
396 Anxiety DisordersFeaturesA goraphobiaBecause Agoraphobia occurs in the context of Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia and Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder  the text and criteria set for Agoraphobia are provided separately in this section  The essential feature of Agoraphobia is anxiety about being in places or situationsfrom which escape might be difficult  or embarrassing  or in which help may not be available in the event of having a Panic Attack  see p  394  or panic-like symptoms  e g   fear of having a sudden attack of dizziness or a sudden attack of diarrhea   Criterion A   The anxiety typically leads to a pervasive avoidance of a variety of situations that may include being alone outside the home or being home alone  being in a crowd of people  traveling in a automobile  bus  or airplane  or being on a bridge or in an elevator  Some individuals are able to expose themselves to the feared situations but endure these experiences with considerable dread  Often an individual is better able to confront a feared situation when accompanied by a companion  Criterion B   Individuals' avoidance of situations may impair their ability to travel to work or to carry out homemaking responsibilities  e g   grocery shopping  taking children to the doctor   The anxiety or phobic avoidance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder  Criterion C   The differential diagnosis to distinguish Agora- phobia from Social and Specific Phobia and from severe Separation Anxiety Disorder can be difficult because all of these conditions are characterized by avoidance of specific situations  The diagnostic issues for boundary cases are discussed in the "Differential Diagnosis" sections of the texts for the disorders in which avoidant behavior is an essential or associated feature Criteria for AgoraphobiaNote  Agoraphobia is not a codable disorder  Code the specific disorder in which the Agoraphobia occurs  e g   300 21 Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia [p  402] or 300 22 Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder [p  404]  A  Anxietyaboutbeinginplacesorsituationsfromwhichescapemightbe difficult  or embarrassing  or in which help may not be available in the event of having an unexpected or situationally predisposed Panic Attack or panic-like symptoms  Agoraphobic fears typically involve character- istic clusters of situations that include being outside the home alone  being in a crowd or standing in a line  being on a bridge  and traveling in a bus  train  or automobile Note  Consider the diagnosis of Specific Phobia if the avoidance is limited to one or only a few specific situations  or Social Phobia if the avoidance islimited to socialsituations B  The situations are avoided  e g   travel is restricted  or else are endured with marked distress or with anxiety about having a Panic Attack or panic-like symptoms  or require the presence of a companion  continued

Panic DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Panic Disorder is the presence of recurrent  unexpected Panic Attacks  see p  394  followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another Panic Attack  worry about the possible implications or consequences of the Panic Attacks  or a significant behavioral change related to the attacks  Criterion A   The Panic Attacks are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   Caffeine Intoxication  or a general medical condition  e g   hyperthyroidism   Criterion C   Finally  the Panic Attacks are not better accounted for by another mental disorder  e g   Specific or Social Phobia  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  or Separation Anxiety Disorder   Criterion D   Depending on whether criteria are also met for Agoraphobia  see p  396   300 21 Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia or 300 01 Panic Disorder Without Agoraphobia is diagnosed  CriterionB  An unexpected  spontaneous  uncued  Panic Attack is defined as one that is not associated with a situational trigger  i e   it occurs "out of the blue"   At least two unexpected Panic Attacks are required for the diagnosis  but most individuals have considerably more  Individuals with Panic Disorder frequently also have situationally predisposed Panic Attacks  i e   those more likely to occur on  but not invariably associated with  exposure to a situational trigger   Situationallybound attacks  i e   those that occur almost invariably and immediately on exposure to a situational trigger  can occur but are less common The frequency and severity of the Panic Attacks vary widely  For example  some individuals have moderately frequent attacks  e g   once a week  that occur regularly for months at a time  Others report short bursts of more frequent attacks  e g   daily for a week  separated by weeks or months without any attacks or with less frequent attacks  e g   two each month  over many years  Limited-symptom attacks  i e   attacks that are identical to "full" Panic Attacks except that the sudden fear or anxiety is accompanied by fewer than 4 of the 13 additional symptoms  are very common in individuals with Panic Disorder  Although the distinction between full Panic Attacks and limited-symptom attacks is somewhat arbitrary  full Panic Attacks are associated with greater morbidity  Most individuals who have limited-symptom attacks have had full Panic Attacks at some time during the course of the disorder Individuals with Panic Disorder display characteristic concerns or attributions aboutPanic Disorder 397
398 Anxiety Disordersthe implications or consequences of the Panic Attacks  Some fear that the attacks indicate the presence of an undiagnosed  life-threatening illness  e g   cardiac disease  seizure disorder   Despite repeated medical testing and reassurance  they may remain frightened and unconvinced that they do not have a life-threatening illness  Others fear that the Panic Attacks are an indication that they are "going crazy" or losing control or are emotionally weak  Some individuals with recurrent Panic Attacks significantly change their behavior  e g   quit a job  in response to the attacks  but deny either fear of having another attack or concerns about the consequences of their Panic Attacks  Concerns about the next attack  or its implications  are often associated with development of avoidant behavior that may meet criteria for Agoraphobia  see p  396   in which case Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia is diagnosed Associated Features and DisordersA ssociated descriptive features and m ental disorders  In addition to worry about Panic Attacks and their implications  many individuals with Panic Disorder also report constant or intermittent feelings of anxiety that are not focused on any specific situation or event  Others become excessively apprehensive about the outcome of routine activities and experiences  particularly those related to health or separation from loved ones  For example  individuals with Panic Disorder often anticipate a catastrophic outcome from a mild physical symptom or medication side effect  e g   thinking that a headache indicates a brain tumor or a hypertensive crisis   Such individuals are also much less tolerant of medication side effects and generally need continued reassurance in order to take medication  In individuals whose Panic Disorder has not been treated or was misdiagnosed  the belief that they have an undetected life-threatening illness may lead to both chronic debilitatinganxiety and excessive visits to health care facilities  This pattern can be both emotionally and financially disruptive In some cases  loss or disruption of important interpersonal relationships  e g   leaving home to live on one's own  divorce  is associated with the onset or exacerbation of Panic Disorder  Demoralization is a common consequence  with many individuals becoming discouraged  ashamed  and unhappy about the difficulties of carrying out their normal routines  They often attribute this problem to a lack of "strength" or "character " This demoralization can become generalized to areas beyond specific panic-related problems  These individuals may frequently be absent from work or school for doctor and emergency-room visits  which can lead to unemployment or dropping out of school Major Depressive Disorder occurs frequently  50%-65%  in individuals with Panic Disorder  In approximately one-third of individuals with both disorders  the depression precedes the onset of Panic Disorder  In the remaining two-thirds  depression occurs coincident with or following the onset of Panic Disorder  A subset of individuals  some of whom may develop a Substance-Related Disorder as a consequence  treat their anxiety with alcohol or medications  Comorbidity with other Anxiety Disorders is also common  especially in clinical settings and in individuals with more severe Agoraphobia  Social Phobia has been reported in 15%-30% of individuals with Panic Disorder  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in 8%-10%  Specific Phobia in 10%-20%  and Generalized Anxiety Disorder in 25%   Separation Anxiety Disorder in childhood has been associated with this disorder Associated laboratory findings  No laboratory findings have been identified that are diagnostic of Panic Disorder  However  a variety of laboratory findings have been noted to be abnormal in groups of individuals with Panic Disorder relative to control
subjects  Some individuals with Panic Disorder show signs of compensated respiratory alkalosis  i e   decreased carbon dioxide and decreased bicarbonate levels with an almost normal pH   Panic Attacks in response to sodium lactate infusion or carbon dioxide inhalation are more common in Panic Disorder than in other Anxiety Disorders Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions Transient tachycardia and moderate elevation of systolic blood pressure may occur during some Panic Attacks  Although studies have suggested that both mitral valve prolapse and thyroid disease are more common among individuals with Panic Disorder than in the general population  others have found no differences in prevalence Specific Culture and Gender FeaturesIn some cultures  Panic Attacks may involve intense fear of witchcraft or magic  Panic Disorder as described here has been found in epidemiological studies throughout the world  Moreover  a number of conditions included in the "Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes"  see Appendix I  may be related to Panic Disorder  Some cultural or ethnic groups restrict the participation of women in public life  and this must be distinguished from Agoraphobia  Panic Disorder Without Agoraphobia is diagnosed twice as often and Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia three times as often in women as in men PrevalenceEpidemiological studies throughout the world consistently indicate the lifetime preva- lence of Panic Disorder  With or Without Agoraphobia  to be between 1 5% and 3-5%  One-year prevalence rates are between 1%and 2% Approximately one-third to one-half of individuals diagnosed with Panic Disorder in community samples also have Agora- phobia  although a much higher rate of Agoraphobia is encountered in clinical samples CourseAge at onset for Panic Disorder varies considerably  but is most typically between late adolescence and the mid-30s  There may be a bimodal distribution  with one peak in late adolescence and a second smaller peak in the mid-30s  A small number of cases begin in childhood  and onset after age 45 years is unusual but can occur  Retrospective descriptions by individuals seen in clinical settings suggest that the usual course is chronic but waxing and waning  Some individuals may have episodic outbreaks with years of remission in between  and others may have continuous severe symptomatology  Although Agoraphobia may develop at any point  its onset is usually within the first year of occurrence of recurrent Panic Attacks  The course of Agoraphobia and its relationship to the course of Panic Attacks are variable  In some cases  a decrease or remission of Panic Attacks may be followed closely by a corresponding decrease in agoraphobic avoidance and anxiety  In others  Agoraphobia may become chronic regardless of the presence or absence of Panic Attacks  Some individuals report that they can reduce the frequency of Panic Attacks by avoiding certain situations  Naturalistic follow-up studies of individuals treated in tertiary care settings  which may select for a poor-prognosis group  suggest that  at 6-10 years posttreatment  about 30% of individuals are well  40%-50% are improved but symptomatic  and the remaining 20%-30% have symptoms that are the same or slightly worse Panic Disorder 399
400 Anxiety DisordersFamilial PatternFirst-degree biological relatives of individuals with Panic Disorder have a four to seven times greater chance of developing Panic Disorder  However  in clinical settings  as many as one-half to three-quarters of individuals with Panic Disorder do not have an affected first-degree biological relative  Twin studies indicate a genetic contribution to the development of Panic Disorder Differential DiagnosisPanic Disorder is not diagnosed if the Panic Attacksare judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition  in which case an Anxiety Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition is diagnosed  see p  436   Examples of general medical conditions that can cause Panic Attacks include hyperthyroidism  hyperparathyroidism  pheochromocytoma  vestibular dysfunctions  seizure disorders  and cardiac conditions  e g   arrhythmias  supraventricular tachycardia   Appropriate laboratory tests  e g   serum calcium levels for hyperparathyroidism  or physical examinations  e g   for cardiac conditions  may be helpful in determining the etiological role of a general medical condition  Panic Disorder is not diagnosed if the Panic Attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a substance  i e   a drug of abuse  a medication   in which case a Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder is diagnosed  see p  439   Intoxication with central nervous system stimulants  e g   cocaine  amphetamines  caffeine  or cannabis and withdrawal from central nervous system depressants  e g   alcohol  barbiturates  can precipitate a Panic Attack  However  if Panic Attacks continue to occur outside of the context of substance use  e g   long after the effects of intoxication or withdrawal have ended   a diagnosis of Panic Disorder should be considered  Features such as onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a Panic Attack  e g   vertigo  loss of consciousness  loss of bladder or bowel control  headaches  slurred speech  or amnesia  suggest the possibility that a general medical condition or a substance may be causing the Panic Attack symptoms Panic Disorder must be distinguished from other mental disorders  e g   other Anxiety Disorders andPsychotic Disorders  that have Panic Attacksas an associated feature  By definition  Panic Disorder is characterized by recurrent  unexpected  spon- taneous  uncued  "out of the blue"  Panic Attacks  As discussed earlier  see p  394   there are three types of Panic Attacksâ€”unexpected  situationally bound  and situationally predisposed  The presence of recurrent unexpected Panic Attacks either initially or later in the course is required for the diagnosis of Panic Disorder  In contrast  PanicAttacks that occur in the context of other Anxiety Disorders are situationally bound or situationally predisposed  e g   in Social Phobia cued by social situations  in Specific Phobia cued by an object or situation  in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder cued by exposure to the object of an obsession [e g   exposure to dirt in someone with an obsession about contamination]  in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder cued by stimuli recalling the stressor  The focus of the anxiety also helps to differentiate Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia from other disorders characterized by avoidant behaviors  Agoraphobic avoidance is associated with the fear of having a Panic Attack  whereas avoidance in other disorders is associated with specific situations  e g   fears of scrutiny  humiliation  and embarrassment in Social Phobia  fears of heights  elevators  or crossing bridges in Specific Phobia  separation concerns in Separation Anxiety Disorder  persecution fears in Delusional Disorder  
Differentiation of Specific Phobia  Situational Type  from Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia may be particularly difficult because both disorders may include Panic Attacks and avoidance of similar types of situations  e g   driving  flying  public transportation  enclosed places   Prototypically  Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia is characterized by the initial onset of unexpected Panic Attacks and the subsequent avoidance of multiple situations thought to be likely triggers of the Panic Attacks  Prototypically  Specific Phobia  Situational Type  is characterized by situational avoid- ance in the absence of recurrent unexpected Panic Attacks  Some presentations fall between these prototypes and require clinical judgment in the selection of the most appropriate diagnosis  Four factors can be helpful in making this judgment  the focus of fear  the type and number of Panic Attacks  the number of situations avoided  and the level of intercurrent anxiety  For example  an individual who had not previously feared or avoided elevators has a Panic Attack in an elevator and begins to dread going to work because of the need to take the elevator to his office on the 24th floor  If this individual subsequently has Panic Attacks only in elevators  even if the focus of fear is on the Panic Attack   then a diagnosis of Specific Phobia may be appropriate  If  however  the individual experiences unexpected Panic Attacks in other situations and begins to avoid or endure with dread other situations because of fear of a Panic Attack  then a diagnosis of Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia would be warranted  Furthermore  the presence of pervasive apprehension about having a Panic Attack even when not anticipating exposure to a phobic situation also supports a diagnosis of Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia  If the individual has additional unexpected Panic Attacks in other situations but no additional avoidance or endurance with dread develops  then the appropriate diagnosis would be Panic Disorder Without Agoraphobia  If the focus of avoidance is not related to having a Panic Attack but concerns some other catastrophe  e g   injury due to the elevator cable breaking   then an additional diagnosis of Specific Phobia may be considered Similarly  distinguishing between Social Phobia and Panic Disorder With Agorapho- bia can be difficult  especially when there is avoidance only of social situations  The focus of fear and the type of Panic Attacks can be helpful in making this distinction  For example  an individual who had not previously had a fear of public speaking has a Panic Attack while giving a talk and begins to dread giving presentations  If thisindividual subsequently has Panic Attacks only in social performance situations  even if the focus of fear is on the possibility of having another Panic Attack   then a diagnosis of Social Phobia may be appropriate  If  however  the individual continues to experience unexpected Panic Attacks in other situations  then a diagnosis of Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia would be warranted  Individuals with Social Phobia fear scrutiny and rarely have a Panic Attack when alone  whereas individuals with Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia may be more anxious in situations where they must be without a trusted companion  In addition  nocturnal Panic Attacks that awaken an individual from sleep are characteristic of Panic Disorder When criteria are met for both Panic Disorder and another Anxiety or Mood Disorder  both disorders should be diagnosed  However  if unexpected Panic Attacks occur in the context of another disorder  e g   Major Depressive Disorder or Generalized Anxiety Disorder  but are not accompanied by a month or more of fear of having additional attacks  associated concerns  or behavior change  the additional diagnosis of Panic Disorder is not made  Because individualswith Panic Disorder may self-medicate their symptoms  comorbid Substance-Related Disorders  most notably related to cannabis  alcohol  and cocaine  are not uncommon Panic Disorder 401

300 22 Agoraphobia WithoutHistoryof Panic DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder are similar to those of Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia except that the focus of fear is on the occurrence of incapacitating or extremely embarrassing panic-like symptoms or limited- symptom attacks rather than full Panic Attacks  Individuals with this disorder have Agoraphobia  see p  396   Criterion A   The "panic-like symptoms" include any of the 13 symptoms listed for Panic Attack  see p  394  or other symptoms that may be incapacitating or embarrassing  e g   loss of bladder control   For example  an individual may be afraid to leave home because of a fear of becoming dizzy  fainting  and then being left helpless on the ground  To qualify for this diagnosis  the full criteria for Panic Disorder must never have been met  Criterion B  and the symptoms must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition  Criterion C   If an associated general medical condition is present  e g   a cardiac condition   the fear of being incapacitated or embarrassed by the development of symptoms  e g   fainting  is clearly in excess of that usually associated with the condition  Criterion D  Specific Culture and Gender FeaturesSome cultural or ethnic groups restrict the participation of women in public life  and this must be distinguished from Agoraphobia  This disorder is diagnosed far more often in females than in males PrevalenceIn clinical settings  almost all individuals  over 95%  who present with Agoraphobia also have a current diagnosis  or history  of Panic Disorder  In contrast  the prevalence of Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder in epidemiological samples has been reported to be higher than that for Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia  However  problems
404 Anxiety Disorderswith assessment appear to have inflated the rates reported in epidemiological studies  Recently  individuals who were given a diagnosis of Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder in an epidemiological study were reevaluated by clinicians using standard interview schedules  The majority were found to have Specific Phobias  but not Agoraphobia CourseRelatively little is known about the course of Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder  Anecdotal evidence suggests that some cases may persist for years and be associated with considerable impairment Differential DiagnosisAgoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder is distinguished from Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia by the absence of a history of recurrent unexpected Panic Attacks  The avoidance in Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder results from fear of incapacitation or humiliation due to unpredictable  sudden  panic-like symptoms rather than from fear of a full Panic Attack as in Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia  The diagnosis of Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia remains appropriate in cases in which Panic Attacks go into remission but Agoraphobia continues to be experienced Other reasons for avoidance must also be distinguished from Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder  In Social Phobia  individuals avoid social or performance situations in which they fear that they might act in a way that is humiliating or embarrassing  In Specific Phobia  the individual avoids a specific feared object or situation  In Major Depressive Disorder  the individual may avoid leaving home due to apathy  loss of energy  and anhedonia  Persecutory fears  as in Delusional Disorder  and fears of contamination  as in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  can also lead to widespread avoidance  In Separation Anxiety Disorder  children avoid situationsthat take them away from home or close relatives Individuals with certain general medical conditions may avoid situations due to realistic concerns about being incapacitated  e g   fainting in an individual with transient ischemic attacks  or being embarrassed  e g   diarrhea in an individual with Crohn's disease   The diagnosis of Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder should be given only if the fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that usually associated with the general medical condition Diagnostic criteria for 300 22 Agoraphobia Without History of Panic DisorderA  The presence of Agoraphobia  see p  396 related to fear of developing panic-like symptoms  e g   dizziness or diarrhea  B  Criteria have never been met for Panic Disorder  see p 402   continued

300 29 Specific Phobia  formerly Simple Phobia Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Specific Phobia is marked and persistent fear of clearly discernible  circumscribed objects or situations  Criterion A   Exposure to the phobic stimulus almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response  Criterion B   This response may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally predisposed Panic Attack  see p  394   Although adolescents and adults with this disorder recognize that their fear is excessive or unreasonable  Criterion C   this may not be the case with children  Most often  the phobic stimulus is avoided  although it is sometimes endured with dread  Criterion D   The diagnosis is appropriate only if the avoidance  fear  or anxious anticipation of encountering the phobic stimulus interferes significantly with the person's daily routine  occupational functioning  or social life  or ifthe person ismarkedly distressed about having the phobia  Criterion E   In individuals under age 18 years  symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months before Specific Phobia is diagnosed  Criterion F   The anxiety  Panic Attacks  or phobic avoidance are not better accounted for by another mental disorder  e g   Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  Separation Anxiety Disorder  Social Phobia  Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia  or Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder   Criterion G  The individual experiences a marked  persistent  and excessive or unreasonable fear when in the presence of  or when anticipating an encounter with  a specific object or situation  The focus of the fear may be anticipated harm from some aspect of the object or situation  e g   an individual may fear air travel because of a concern about crashing  may fear dogs because of concerns about being bitten  or may fear driving because of concerns about being hit by other vehicles on the road   Specific Phobias may also involve concerns about losing control  panicking  and fainting that might occur on exposure to the feared object  For example  individuals afraid of blood and injury may also worry about the possibility of fainting  people afraid of heights may also worry about dizziness  and people afraid of closed-in situations may also worry about losing control and screaming Anxiety is almost invariably felt immediately on confronting the phobic stimulus  e g   a person with a Specific Phobia of cats will almost invariably have an immediate
406 Anxiety Disordersanxiety response when forced to confront a cat   The level of anxiety or fear usually varies as a function of both the degree of proximity to the phobic stimulus  e g   fear intensifies as the cat approaches and decreases as the cat withdraws  and the degree to which escape from the phobic stimulus is limited  e g   fear intensifies as the elevator approaches the midway point between floors and decreases as the doors open at the next floor   However  the intensity of the fear may not always relate predictably to the phobic stimulus  e g   a person afraid of heights may experience variable amounts of fear when crossing the same bridge on different occasions   Sometimes full-blownPanic Attacks are experienced in response to the phobic stimulus  especially when the person must remain in the situation or believes that escape will be impossible  Because marked anticipatory anxiety occurs if the person is confronted with the necessity of entering into the phobic situation  such situations are usually avoided  Less commonly  the person forces himself or herself to endure the phobic situation  but it is experienced with intense anxiety Adults with this disorder recognize that the phobia is excessive or unreasonable  The diagnosis would be Delusional Disorder instead of Specific Phobia for an individual who avoids an elevator because of a conviction that it has been sabotaged and who does not recognize that this fear is excessive and unreasonable  Moreover  the diagnosis should not be given if the fear is reasonable given the context of the stimuli  e g   fear of being shot in a hunting area or a dangerous neighborhood   Insight into the excessive or unreasonable nature of the fear tends to increase with age and is not required to make the diagnosis in children Fears of circumscribed objects or situations are very common  especially in children  but in many cases the degree of impairment is insufficient to warrant a diagnosis  If the phobia does not significantly interfere with the individual's functioning or cause marked distress  the diagnosis is not made  For example  a person who is afraid of snakes to the point of expressing intense fear in the presence of snakes would not receive a diagnosis of Specific Phobia if he or she lives in an area devoid of snakes  is not restricted in activities by the fear of snakes  and is not distressed about having a fear of snakes SubtypesThe following subtypes may be specified to indicate the focus of fear or avoidance in Specific Phobia  e g   Specific Phobia  Animal Type  Animal Type  This subtype should be specified if the fear is cued by animals or insects  This subtype generally has a childhood onset Natural Environment Type  This subtype should be specified if the fear is cued by objects in the natural environment  such as storms  heights  or water  This subtype generally has a childhood onset Blood-Injection-Injury Type  This subtype should be specified if the fear is cued by seeing blood or an injury or by receiving an injection or other invasive medical procedure  This subtype is highly familial and is often characterized by a strong vasovagal response Situational Type  This subtype should be specified if the fear is cued by a specific situation such as public transportation  tunnels  bridges  elevators  flying  driving  or enclosed places  This subtype has a bimodal age-at-onset distribution  with one peak in childhood and another peak in the mid-20s  This subtype
appears to be similar to Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia in its characteristic sex ratios  familial aggregation pattern  and age at onset Other Type  This subtype should be specified if the fear is cued by other stimuli  These stimuli might include the fear or avoidance of situations that might lead to choking  vomiting  or contracting an illness  "space" phobia  i e   the individual is afraid of falling down if away from walls or other means of physical support   and children's fears of loud sounds or costumed characters The frequency of the subtypes in adult clinical settings  from most to least frequent  is Situational  Natural Environment  Blood-Injection-Injury  and Animal  In many cases  more than one subtype of Specific Phobia is present  Having one phobia of a specific subtype tends to increase the likelihood of having another phobia from within the same subtype  e g   fear of cats and snakes   When more than one subtype applies  they should all be noted  e g   Specific Phobia  Animal and Natural Environment Types  Associated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Specific Phobia may re- sult in a restricted lifestyle or interference with certain occupations  depending on the type of phobia  For example  job promotion may be threatened by avoidance of air travel  and social activities may be restricted by fears of crowded or closed-in places  Specific Phobias frequently co-occur with other Anxiety Disorders but are rarely the focus of clinical attention in these situations  The Specific Phobia is usually associated with less distress or less interference with functioning than the comorbid main diagnosis  There is a particularly frequent co-occurrence between Specific Phobias and Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions  Avasovagal fainting response is characteristic of Blood-Injection-Injury Type Specific Phobias  approximately 75% of such individuals report a history of fainting in these situations  The physiological response is characterized by an initial brief acceleration of heart rate followed by a deceleration of heart rate and a drop in blood pressure  which contrasts with the usual acceleration of heart rate in other Specific Phobias  Certain general medical conditions may be exacerbated as a consequence of phobic avoidance  For example  Specific Phobias  Blood-Injection-Injury Type  may have detrimental effects on dental or physical health  because the individual may avoid obtaining necessary medical care  Similarly  fears of choking may have a detrimental effect on health when food is limited to substances that are easy to swallow or when oral medication is avoided Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesThe content of phobias as well as their prevalence varies with culture and ethnicity  For example  fears of magic or spirits are present in many cultures and should be considered a Specific Phobia only if the fear is excessive in the context of that culture and causes significant impairment or distress In children  the anxiety may be expressed by crying  tantrums  freezing  or clinging  Children often do not recognize that the fears are excessive or unreasonable and rarely300 29 Specific Phobia 407

300 29 Specific Phobia 409 are likely to have phobias of situations   Fears of blood and injury have particularlystrong familial patterns Differential DiagnosisSpecific Phobias differ from most other AnxietyDisorders in levels of intercurrentanxiety  Typically  individuals with Specific Phobia  unlike those with Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia  do not present with pervasive anxiety  because their fear is limited to specific  circumscribed objects or situations  However  generalized anxious anticipation may emerge under conditions in which encounters with the phobic stimulus become more likely  e g   when a person who is fearful of snakes moves to a desert area  or when life events force immediate confrontation with the phobic stimulus  e g   when a person who is fearful of flying is forced by circumstances to fly  Differentiation of Specific Phobia  Situational Type  from Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia may be particularly difficult because both disorders may include Panic Attacks and avoidance of similar types of situations  e g   driving  flying  public transportation  and enclosed places   Prototypically  Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia is characterized by the initial onset of unexpected Panic Attacks and the subsequent avoidance of multiple situations thought to be likely triggers of the Panic Attacks  Prototypically  Specific Phobia  Situational Type  is characterized by situational avoid- ance in the absence of recurrent unexpected Panic Attacks  Some presentations fall between these prototypes and require clinical judgment in the selection of the most appropriate diagnosis  Four factors can be helpful in making this judgment  the focus of fear  the type and number of Panic Attacks  the number of situations avoided  and the level of intercurrent anxiety  For example  an individual who had not previously feared or avoided elevators has a Panic Attack in an elevator and begins to dread going to work because of the need to take the elevator to his office on the 24th floor  If this individual subsequently has Panic Attacks only in elevators  even if the focus of fear is on the Panic Attack   then a diagnosis of Specific Phobia may be appropriate  If  however  the individual experiences unexpected Panic Attacks in other situations and begins to avoid or endure with dread other situations because of fear of a Panic Attack  then a diagnosis of Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia would be warranted  Furthermore  the presence of pervasive apprehension about having a Panic Attack even when not anticipating exposure to a phobic situation also supports a diagnosis of Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia  If the individual has additional unexpected Panic Attacks in other situations but no additional avoidance or endurance with dread develops  then the appropriate diagnosis would be Panic Disorder Without Agoraphobia Concurrent diagnoses of Specific Phobia and Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia are sometimes warranted  In these cases  consideration of the focus of the individual's concern about the phobic situation may be helpful  For example  avoidance of being alone because of concern about having unexpected Panic Attacks warrants a diagnosis of Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia  if other criteria are met   whereas the additional phobic avoidance of air travel  if due to worries about bad weather conditions and crashing  may warrant an additional diagnosis of Specific Phobia Specific Phobia and Social Phobia can be differentiated on the basis of the focus of the fears  For example  avoidance of eating in a restaurantmay be based on concerns about negative evaluation from others  i e   Social Phobia  or concerns about choking  i e   Specific Phobia   In contrast to the avoidance in Specific Phobia  the avoidance in

300 23 Social Phobia  Social AnxietyDisorder Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Social Phobia is a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur  Criterion A   Exposure to the social or performance situation almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response  Criterion B   This response may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally predisposed Panic Attack  see p  394   Although adolescents and adults with this disorder recognize that their fear is excessive or unreasonable  Criterion C   this may not be the case with children  Most often  the social or performance situation is avoided  although it is sometimes endured with dread  Criterion D   The diagnosis is appropriate only if the avoidance  fear  or anxious anticipation of encountering the social or performance situation interferes significantly with the person's daily routine  occupa- tional functioning  or social life  or if the person is markedly distressed about having the phobia  Criterion E   In individuals younger than age 18 years  symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months before Social Phobia is diagnosed  Criterion F   The fear or avoidance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition and is not better accounted for by another mental disorder  e g   Panic Disorder  Separation Anxiety Disorder  Body Dysmorphic Disorder  a Pervasive Devel- opmental Disorder  or Schizoid Personality Disorder   Criterion G   If another mental300 23 Social Phobia 411

and social interactional situations  Because individuals with Social Phobia often do not spontaneously report the full range of their social fears  it is useful for the clinician to review a list of social and performance situations with the individual  Individuals whose clinical manifestationsdo not meet the definition of General- ized compose a heterogeneous group that includes persons who fear a single performance situation as well as those who fear several  but not most  social situations  Individuals with Social Phobia  Generalized  may be more likely to manifest deficits in social skills and to have severe social and work impairment Associated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Common associated fea- tures of Social Phobia include hypersensitivity to criticism  negative evaluation  or rejection  difficulty being assertive  and low self-esteem or feelings of inferiority  Individuals with Social Phobia also often fear indirect evaluation by others  such as taking a test  They may manifest poor social skills  e g   poor eye contact  or observable signs of anxiety  e g   cold clammy hands  tremors  shaky voice   Individuals with Social Phobia often underachieve in school due to test anxiety or avoidance of classroom participation  They may underachieve at work because of anxiety during  or avoidance of  speaking in groups  in public  or to authority figures and colleagues  Persons with Social Phobia often have decreased social support networks and are less likely to marry  In more severe cases  individuals may drop out of school  be unemployed and not seek work due to difficulty interviewing for jobs  have no friends or cling to unfulfilling relationships  completely refrain from dating  or remain with their family of origin Social Phobia may be associated with Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia  Agorapho- bia Without History of Panic Disorder  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  Mood Disorders  Substance-Related Disorders  and Somatization Disorder and usually precedes these disorders  In clinical samples  Avoidant Personality Disorder is frequently present in individuals with Social Phobia  Generalized Associated laboratory findings  Compared with those with Panic Disorder  individ-uals with Social Phobia are less likely to develop a Panic Attack in response to sodium lactate infusion or carbon dioxide inhalation  This finding supports the differentiation of Social Phobia from Panic Disorder  although none of these findings are considered to be diagnostic of these disorders Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesClinical presentation and resulting impairmentmay differ across cultures  depending on social demands  In certain cultures  e g  Japan and Korea   individualswith Social Phobia may develop persistent and excessive fears of giving offense to others in social situations  instead of being embarrassed  These fears may take the form of extreme anxiety that blushing  eye-to-eye contact  or one's body odor will be offensive to others  taijin kyofusho in Japan  In children  crying  tantrums  freezing  clinging or staying close to a familiar person  and inhibited interactions to the point of mutism may be present  Young children may appear excessively timid in unfamiliar social settings  shrink from contact with others  refuse to participate in group play  typically stay on the periphery of social activities 300 23 Social Phobia 413
4l4 Anxiety Disordersand attempt to remain close to familiar adults  Unlike adults  children with Social Phobia usually do not have the option of avoiding feared situations altogether and may be unable to identify the nature of their anxiety  There may be a decline in classroom performance  school refusal  or avoidance of age-appropriate social activities and dating  To make the diagnosis in children  there must be evidence of capacity for social relationships with familiar people and the social anxiety must occur in peer settings  not just in interactions with adults  Because of the disorder's early onset and chronic course  impairment in children tends to take the form of failure to achieve an expected level of functioning  rather than a decline from an optimal level of functioning  In contrast  when the onset is in adolescence  the disorder may lead to decrements in social and academic performance Epidemiological and community-based studies suggest that Social Phobia is more common in women than in men  In most clinical samples  however  the sexes are either equally represented or the majority are male PrevalenceEpidemiological and community-based studies have reported a lifetime prevalence of Social Phobia ranging from 3% to 13%  The reported prevalence may vary depending on the threshold used to determine distress or impairment and the number of types of social situations specifically surveyed  In one study  20% reported excessive fear of public speaking and performance  but only about 2% appeared to experience enough impairment or distress to warrant a diagnosis of Social Phobia  In the general population  most individuals with Social Phobia fear public speaking  whereas somewhat less than half fear speaking to strangers or meeting new people  Other performance fears  e g   eating  drinking  or writing in public  or using a public restroom  appear to be less common  In clinical settings  the vast majority of persons with Social Phobia fear more than one type of social situation  Social Phobia is rarely the reason for admission to inpatient settings  In outpatient clinics  rates of Social Phobia have ranged between 10% and 20% of individuals with Anxiety Disorders  but rates vary widely by site CourseSocial Phobia typically has an onset in the mid-teens  sometimes emerging out of a childhood history of social inhibition or shyness  Some individuals report an onset in early childhood  Onset may abruptly follow a stressful or humiliating experience  or it may be insidious  The course of Social Phobia is often continuous  Duration is frequently lifelong  although the disorder may attenuate in severity or remit during adulthood  Severity of impairment may fluctuate with life stressors and demands  For example  Social Phobia may diminish after a person with fear of dating marries and reemerge after death of a spouse  A job promotion to a position requiring public speaking may result in the emergence of Social Phobia in someone who previously never needed to speak in public Familial PatternSocial Phobia appears to occur more frequently among first-degree biological relatives of those with the disorder compared with the general population 
Differential DiagnosisIndividuals with both Panic Attacksand social avoidance sometimes present a potentially difficult diagnostic problem  Prototypically  Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia is characterized by the initial onset of unexpected Panic Attacks and the subsequent avoidance of multiple situations thought to be likely triggers of the Panic Attacks  Although social situations may be avoided in Panic Disorder due to the fear of being seen while having a Panic Attack  Panic Disorder is characterized by recurrent unex- pected Panic Attacks that are not limited to social situations  and the diagnosis of Social Phobia is not made when the only social fear is of being seen while having a Panic Attack Prototypically SocialPhobiaischaracterizedbytheavoidance ofsocialsituations in the absence of recurrent unexpected Panic Attacks  When Panic Attacks do occur  they take the form of situationallybound or situationally predisposed Panic Attacks e g   a person with fear of embarrassment when speaking in public experiences Panic Attacks cued only by public speaking or other social situations   Some presentations fall between these prototypes and require clinical judgment in the selection of the most appropriate diagnosis  For example  an individual who had not previously had a fear of public speaking has a Panic Attack while giving a talk and begins to dread giving presentations  If this individual subsequently has Panic Attacks only in social performance situations  even if the focus of fear is on the panic   then a diagnosis of Social Phobia may be appropriate  If  however  the individual continues to experience unexpected Panic Attacks  then a diagnosis of Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia would be warranted  If criteria are met for both Social Phobia and Panic Disorder  both diagnoses may be given  For example  an individual with lifelong fear and avoidance of most social situations  Social Phobia  later develops Panic Attacks in nonsocial situations and a variety of additional avoidance behaviors  Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia  Avoidance of situations because of a fear of possible humiliation is highly prominent in Social Phobia  but may also at times occur in Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia and Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder  The situations avoided in Social Phobia are limited to those involving possible scrutiny by other people  Fears in Agoraphobia Without History of Panic Disorder typically involve characteristic clusters of situations that may or may not involve scrutiny by others  e g   being alone outside the home or being home alone  being on a bridge or in an elevator  traveling in abus  train  automobile  or airplane   The role of a companion also may be useful in distinguishing Social Phobia from Agoraphobia  With and Without Panic Disorder   Typically  individuals with agoraphobic avoidance prefer to be with a trusted companion when in the feared situation  whereas individuals with Social Phobia may have marked anticipatory anxiety  but characteristicallydo not have Panic Attacks when alone  A person with Social Phobia who fears crowded stores would feel scrutinized with or without a companion and might be less anxious without the added burden of perceived scrutiny by the companion Children with Separation Anxiety Disorder may avoid social settings due to concerns about being separated from their caretaker  concerns about being embarrassed by needing to leave prematurely to return home  or concerns about requiring the presence of a parent when it is not developmentally appropriate  A separate diagnosis of Social Phobia is generally not warranted  Children with Separation Anxiety Disorder are usually comfortable in social settings in their own home  whereas those with Social Phobia display signs of discomfort even when feared social situations occur at home Although fear of embarrassment or humiliation may be present in Generalized300 23 Social Phobia 415

418 Anxiety Disorders Criterion D   The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition  Criterion E  Obsessions are persistent ideas  thoughts  impulses  or images that are experienced as intrusive and inappropriate and that cause marked anxiety or distress  The intrusive and inappropriate quality of the obsessions has been referred to as "ego-dystonic " This refers to the individual's sense that the content of the obsession is alien  not within his or her own control  and not the kind of thought that he or she would expect to have  However  the individual is able to recognize that the obsessions are the product of his or her own mind and are not imposed from without  as in thought insertion  The most common obsessions are repeated thoughts about contamination  e g   becoming contaminated by shaking hands   repeated doubts  e g   wondering whether one has performed some act such as having hurt someone in a traffic accident or having left a door unlocked   a need to have things in a particular order  e g   intense distress when objects are disordered or asymmetrical   aggressive or horrific impulses  e g   to hurt one's child or to shout an obscenity in church   and sexual imagery  e g   a recurrent pornographic image   The thoughts  impulses  or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems  e g   concerns about current ongoing difficulties in life  such as financial  work  or school problems  and are unlikely to be related to a real-life problem The individual with obsessions usually attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts or impulses or to neutralize them with some other thought or action  i e   a compulsion   For example  an individual plagued by doubts about having turned off the stove attempts to neutralize them by repeatedly checking to ensure that it is off Compulsions are repetitive behaviors  e g   hand washing  ordering  checking  or mental acts  e g   praying  counting  repeating words silently  the goal of which is to prevent or reduce anxiety or distress  not to provide pleasure or gratification  In most cases  the person feels driven to perform the compulsion to reduce the distress that accompanies an obsession or to prevent some dreaded event or situation  For example  individuals with obsessions about being contaminated may reduce their mental distress by washing their hands until their skin is raw  individuals distressed by obsessions about having left a door unlocked may be driven to check the lock every few minutes  individuals distressed by unwanted blasphemous thoughts may find relief in counting to 10 backward and forward 100 times for each thought  In some cases  individuals perform rigid or stereotyped acts according to idiosyncraticallyelaborated rules without being able to indicate why they are doing them  By definition  compulsions are either clearly excessive or are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent  The most common compulsions involve washing and cleaning  counting  checking  requesting or demanding assurances  repeating actions  and ordering By definition  adults with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder have at some point recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable  This requirement does not apply to children because they may lack sufficient cognitive awareness to make this judgment  However  even in adults there is a broad range of insight into the reasonableness of the obsessions or compulsions  Some individuals are uncertain about the reasonableness of their obsessions or compulsions  and any given individual's insight may vary across times and situations  For example  the person may recognize a contamination compulsion as unreasonable when discussing it in a "safe situation"  e g   in the therapist's office   but not when forced to handle money  At those times when the individual recognizes that the obsessions and compulsions are unrea-

300 3 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 421Differential DiagnosisObsessive-Compulsive Disorder must be distinguished from Anxiety Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  The diagnosis is Anxiety Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition when the obsessions or compulsions are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition  see p  436  This determination is based on history  laboratory findings  or physical examination  A Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder is distinguished from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder by the fact that a substance  i e   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the obsessions or compulsions  see p  439  Recurrent or intrusive thoughts  impulses  images  or behaviors may occur in the context of many other mental disorders  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is not diag- nosed if the content of the thoughts or the activities is exclusively related to another mental disorder  e g   preoccupation with appearance in Body Dysmorphic Disorder  preoccupation with a feared object or situation in Specific or Social Phobia  hairpulling in Trichotillomania   An additional diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder may still be warranted if there are obsessions or compulsions whose content is unrelated to the other mental disorder In a Major Depressive Episode  persistent brooding about potentially unpleasant circumstances or about possible alternative actions is common and is considered a mood-congruent aspect of depression rather than an obsession  For example  a depressed individual who ruminates that he is worthless would not be considered to have obsessions because such brooding is not ego-dystonic Generalized Anxiety Disorder is characterized by excessive worry  but such worries are distinguished from obsessions by the fact that the person experiences them as excessive concerns about real-life circumstances  For example  an excessive concern that one may lose one's job would constitute a worry  not an obsession  In contrast  the content of obsessions does not typically involve real-life problems  and the obsessions are experienced as inappropriate by the individual  e g   the intrusive distressing idea that "God" is "dog" spelled backward  If recurrent distressing thoughts are exclusively related to fears of having  or the idea that one has  a serious disease based on misinterpretation of bodily symptoms  then Hypochondriasis should be diagnosed instead of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  However  if the concern about having an illness is accompanied by rituals such as excessive washing or checking behavior related to concerns about the illness or about spreading it to other people  then an additional diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder may be indicated  If the major concern is about contracting an illness  rather than having an illness  and no rituals are involved  then a Specific Phobia of illness may be the more appropriate diagnosis The ability of individuals to recognize that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable occurs on a continuum  In some individuals with Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder  reality testing may be lost  and the obsession may reach delusional proportions  e g   the belief that one has caused the death of another person by having willed it   In such cases  the presence of psychotic features may be indicated by an additional diagnosis of Delusional Disorder or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified  The specifier With Poor Insight may be useful in those situations that are on the boundary between obsession and delusion  e g   an individual whose extreme preoccupation with contamination  although exaggerated  is less intense than in a

430 Anxiety Disordersis persistently reexperienced  e g   recurrent recollections  images  thoughts  dreams  illusions  flashback episodes  a sense of reliving the event  or distress on exposure to reminders of the event   Second  reminders of the trauma  e g   places  people  activities  are avoided  Finally  hyperarousal in response to stimuli reminiscent of the trauma is present  e g   difficulty sleeping  irritability  poor concentration  hypervigilance  an exaggerated startle response  and motor restlessness  Associated Features and DisordersA ssociated descriptive features and m ental disorders  Symptoms of despair and hopelessness may be experienced in Acute Stress Disorder and may be sufficiently severe and persistent to meet criteria for a Major Depressive Episode  in which case an additional diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder may be warranted  If the trauma led to another's death or to serious injury  survivors may feel guilt about having remained intact or about not providing enough help to others  Individuals with this disorder often perceive themselves to have greater responsibility for the consequences of the trauma than is warranted  Problems may result from the individual's neglect of basic health and safety needs associated with the aftermath of the trauma  Individuals with this disorder are at increased risk for the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  Impulsive and risk-taking behavior may occur after the trauma Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions General medical conditions may occur as a consequence of the trauma  e g   head injury  burns  Specific Culture FeaturesAlthough some events are likely to be universally experienced as traumatic  the severity and pattern of response may be modulated by cultural differences in the implications of loss  There may also be culturally prescribed coping behaviors that are characteristic of particular cultures  For example  dissociative symptoms may be a more prominent part of the acute stress response in cultures in which such behaviors are sanctioned  For further discussion of culturalfactors related to traumatic events  see p  426 PrevalenceThe prevalence of Acute Stress Disorder in a population exposed to a serious traumatic stress depends on the severity and persistence of the trauma and the degree of exposure to it CourseSymptoms of Acute Stress Disorder are experienced during or immediately after the trauma  last for at least 2 days  and either resolve within 4 weeks after the conclusion of the traumatic event or the diagnosis is changed  When symptoms persist beyond 1 month  a diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder may be appropriate if the full criteria for PosttraumaticStress Disorder are met  The severity  duration  and proximit of an individual's exposure to the traumatic event are the most important factors in determining the likelihood of development of Acute Stress Disorder  There is some
evidence that social supports  family history  childhood experiences  personality vari- ables  and preexisting mental disorders may influence the development of AcuteStress Disorder  This disorder can develop in individualswithout any predisposing conditions  particularly if the stressor is especially extreme Differential DiagnosisSome symptomatology following exposure to an extreme stress is ubiquitous and often does not require any diagnosis  Acute Stress Disorder should only be considered if the symptoms last at least 2 days and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning or impair the individual's ability to pursue some necessary task  e g   obtaining necessary assistance or mobilizing personal resources by telling family members about the traumatic experience  Acute Stress Disorder must be distinguished from a Mental Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  e g   head trauma   see p  165  and from a Substance- Induced Disorder  e g   related to Alcohol Intoxication   see p  192   which may be common consequences of exposure to an extreme stressor  In some individuals  psychotic symptoms may occur following an extreme stressor  In such cases  Brief Psychotic Disorder is diagnosed instead of Acute Stress Disorder  If a Major Depres- sive Episode develops after the trauma  a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder should be considered in addition to a diagnosis of Acute Stress Disorder  A separate diagnosis of Acute Stress Disorder should not be made if the symptoms are an exacerbation of a preexisting mental disorder By definition  a diagnosis of Acute Stress Disorder is appropriate only for symptoms that occur within 1 month of the extreme stressor  Because Posttraumatic Stress Disorder requires more than 1 month of symptoms  this diagnosis cannot be made during this initial 1-month period  For individuals with the diagnosis of Acute Stress Disorder whose symptoms persist for longer than 1 month  the diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder should be considered  For individuals who have an extreme stressor but who develop a symptom pattern that does not meet criteria for Acute Stress Disorder  a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder should be considered Malingering must be ruled out in those situationsin which financialremuneration  benefit eligibility  or forensic determinations play a role Diagnostic criteria for 308 3 Acute Stress DisorderA  The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the following were present  1  the person experienced  witnessed  or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury  or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others 2  the person's response involved intense fear  helplessness  or horrorB  Either while experiencing or after experiencing the distressing event  the individual has three  or more  of the following dissociative symptoms 308 3 Acute Stress Disorder 431 continued

300 02 Generalized Anxiety Disorder  Includes Overanxious Disorder of Childhood Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Generalized Anxiety Disorder is excessive anxiety and worry  apprehensive expectation   occurring more days than not for a period of at least 6 months  about a number of events or activities  Criterion A   The individual finds it
300 02 Generalized Anxiety Disorder 433difficult to control the worry  Criterion B   The anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three additional symptoms from a list that includes restlessness  being easily fatigued  difficulty concentrating  irritability  muscle tension  and disturbed sleep  only one additional symptom is required in children   Criterion C   The focus of the anxiety and worry is not confined to features of another Axis I disorder such as having a Panic Attack  as in Panic Disorder   being embarrassed in public  as in Social Phobia   being contaminated  as in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder   being away from home or close relatives  as in Separation Anxiety Disorder   gaining weight  as in Anorexia Nervosa   having multiple physical complaints  as in Somatization Disorder   or having a serious illness  as in Hypochondriasis   and the anxiety and worry do not occur exclusively during Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  Criterion D   Although individuals with General- ized Anxiety Disorder may not always identify the worries as "excessive " they report subjective distress due to constant worry  have difficulty controlling the worry  or experience related impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion E   The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  i e   a drug of abuse  a medication  or toxin exposure  or a general medical condition and does not occur exclusively during a Mood Disorder  a Psychotic Disorder  or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder  CriterionF  The intensity  duration  or frequency of the anxiety and worry is far out of proportion to the actual likelihood or impact of the feared event  The person finds it difficult to keep worrisome thoughts from interfering with attention to tasks at hand and has difficulty stopping the worry  Adults with Generalized Anxiety Disorder often worry about everyday  routine life circumstances such as possible job responsibilities  finances  the health of family members  misfortune to their children  or minor matters  such as household chores  car repairs  or being late for appointments   Children with Generalized Anxiety Disorder tend to worry excessively about their competence or the quality of their performance  During the course of the disorder  the focus of worry may shift from one concern to another Associated Features and DisordersAssociated with muscle tension  there may be trembling  twitching  feeling shaky  and muscle aches or soreness  Many individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder also experience somatic symptoms  e g   cold  clammy hands  dry mouth  sweating  nausea or diarrhea  urinary frequency  trouble swallowing or a "lump in the throat"  and an exaggerated startle response  Depressive symptoms are also common Generalized Anxiety Disorder very frequently co-occurs with Mood Disorders  e g   Major Depressive Disorder or Dysthymic Disorder   with other Anxiety Disorders  e g   Panic Disorder  Social Phobia  Specific Phobia   and with Substance-Related Disorders  e g   Alcohol or Sedative  Hypnotic  or Anxiolytic Dependence or Abuse   Other conditions that may be associated with stress  e g   irritable bowel syndrome  headaches  frequently accompany Generalized Anxiety Disorder Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesThere is considerable cultural variation in the expression of anxiety  e g   in some cultures  anxiety is expressed predominantly through somatic symptoms  in others through cognitive symptoms   It is important to consider the cultural context when
434 Anxiety Disordersevaluating whether worries about certain situations are excessive In children and adolescents with Generalized Anxiety Disorder  the anxieties andworries often concern the quality of their performance or competence at school or in sporting events  even when their performance is not being evaluated by others  There may be excessive concerns about punctuality  They may also worry about catastrophic events such as earthquakes or nuclear war  Children with the disorder may be overly conforming  perfectionist  and unsure of themselves and tend to redo tasks because of excessive dissatisfaction with less-than-perfect performance  They are typically over- zealous in seeking approval and require excessive reassurance about their performance and their other worries In clinical settings  the disorder is diagnosed somewhat more frequently in women than in men  about 55%-60% of those presenting with the disorder are female   In epidemiological studies  the sex ratio is approximately two-thirds female PrevalenceIn a community sample  the 1-year prevalence rate for Generalized Anxiety Disorder was approximately 3%  and the lifetime prevalence rate was 5%  In anxiety disorder clinics  approximately 12% of the individuals present with Generalized Anxiety Disorder CourseMany individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder report that they have felt anxious and nervous all their lives  Although over half of those presenting for treatment report onset in childhood or adolescence  onset occurring after age 20 years is not uncommon  The course is chronic but fluctuating and often worsens during times of stress Familial PatternAnxiety as a trait has a familial association  Inconsistent findings have been reported regarding familial patterns for Generalized Anxiety Disorder  with most reports failing to find specific familial aggregation Differential DiagnosisGeneralized Anxiety Disorder must be distinguished from an Anxiety Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  The diagnosis is Anxiety Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition if the anxiety symptoms are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition  e g   pheochromocytoma  hyper- thyroidism   see p  436   This determination is based on history  laboratory findings  or physical examination  A Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder is distinguished from Generalized Anxiety Disorder by the fact that a substance  i e   a drug of abuse  a medication  or exposure to a toxin  is judged to be etiologically related to the anxiety disturbance  see p  439   For example  severe anxiety that occurs only in the context of heavy coffee consumption would be diagnosed as Caffeine-Induced AnxietyDisorder  With GeneralizedAnxiety When another Axis I disorder is present  an additional diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder should be made only when the focus of the anxiety and worry is unrelated to the other disorder  that is  the excessive worry is not restricted to having a
300 02 Generalized Anxiety Disorder 435Panic Attack  as in Panic Disorder   being embarrassed in public  as in Social Phobia   being contaminated  as in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder   gaining weight  as in Anorexia Nervosa   having a serious illness  as inHypochondriasis   havingmultiple physical complaints  as in Somatization Disorder   or to concerns about the welfare of close relations or being away from them or from home  as in Separation Anxiety Disorder   For example  the anxiety present in Social Phobia is focused on upcoming social situations in which the individual must perform or be evaluated by others  whereas individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder experience anxiety whether or not they are being evaluated Several features distinguish the excessive worry of Generalized Anxiety Disorder from the obsessional thoughts of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  Obsessional thoughts are not simply excessive worries about everyday or real-life problems  but rather are ego-dystonic intrusions that often take the form of urges  impulses  and images in addition to thoughts  Finally  most obsessions are accompanied by compulsions that reduce the anxiety associated with the obsessions Anxiety is invariably present in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  Generalized Anxiety Disorder is not diagnosed if the anxiety occurs exclusively during the course of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  Anxiety may also be present in Adjustment Disorder  but this residual category should be used only when the criteria are not met for any other Anxiety Disorder  including Generalized Anxiety Disorder   Moreover  in Adjust- ment Disorder the anxiety occurs in response to a life stressor and does not persist for more than 6 months after the termination of the stressor or its consequences  Generalized anxiety is a common associated feature of Mood Disorders and Psychotic Disorders and should not be diagnosed separately if it occurs exclusively during the course of these conditions Several features distinguish Generalized Anxiety Disorder from nonpathological anxiety  First  the worries associated with Generalized Anxiety Disorder are difficult to control and typically interfere significantly with functioning  whereas the worries of everyday life are perceived as more controllable and can be put off until later  Second  the worries associated with Generalized Anxiety Disorder are more pervasive  pro- nounced  distressing  and of longer duration and frequently occur without precipitants  The more life circumstances about which a person worries excessively  finances  children's safety  job performance  car repairs   the more likely the diagnosis  Third  everyday worries are much less likely to be accompanied by physical symptoms  e g   excessive fatigue  restlessness  feeling keyed up or on edge  irritability   although this is less true of children Diagnostic criteria for 300 02 Generalized Anxiety DisorderA  Excessive anxiety and worry  apprehensive expectation   occurring more days than not for at least 6 months  about a number of events or activities  such as work or school performance  B  The person finds it difficult to control the worry  continued

Substance-Induced Anxiety DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder are prominent anxiety symptoms  Criterion A  that are judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  i e   a drug of abuse  a medication  or toxin exposure   Criterion B   Depending on the nature of the substance and the context in which the symptoms occur  i e   during intoxication or withdrawal   the disturbance may involve prominent anxiety  Panic Attacks  phobias  or obsessions or compulsions  Although the clinical presentation of the Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder may resemble that of Panic Disorder  Generalized Anxiety Disorder  Social Phobia  or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  the full criteria for one of these disorders need not be met  The disturbance must not be better accounted for by a mental disorder  e g   another Anxiety Disorder  that is not
440 Anxiety Disorderssubstance induced  Criterion C   The diagnosis is not made if the anxiety symptoms occur only during the course of a delirium  Criterion D   The symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion E   This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of Substance Intoxication or Substance Withdrawal only when the anxiety symptoms are in excess of those usually associated with the intoxication or withdrawal syndrome and when the anxiety symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention  For a more detailed discussion of Substance-RelatedDisorders  see p  175 A Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder is distinguished from a primary Anxiety Disorder by considering the onset  course  and other factors  For drugs of abuse  there must be evidence from the history  physical examination  or laboratory findings of intoxication or withdrawal  Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorders arise only in associa- tion with intoxication or withdrawal states  whereas primary Anxiety Disorders may precede the onset of substance use or occur during times of sustained abstinence  Because the withdrawal state for some substances  e g   some benzodiazepines  can be relatively protracted  the onset of the anxiety symptoms can occur up to 4 weeks after cessation of substance use  Another consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of a primary Anxiety Disorder  e g   atypical age at onset or course   For example  the onset of Panic Disorder after age 45 years  which is rare  or the presence ofatypical symptoms during a Panic Attack  e g   true vertigo  loss of balance  consciousness  or bladder or bowel control  headaches  slurred speech  or amnesia  may suggest a substance-induced etiology  In contrast  factors suggesting that the anxiety symptoms are better accounted for by a primary Anxiety Disorder include persistence of anxiety symptoms for a substantial period of time  i e   about a month  after the end of Substance Intoxication or acute Withdrawal  the development of symptoms that are substantially in excess of what would be expected given the type or amount of the substance used or the duration of use  or a history of prior recurrent primary Anxiety Disorders SpecifiersThe following specifiers can be used to indicate which symptom presentation pre- dominates With Generalized Anxiety  This specifier may be used if excessive anxiety or worry about a number of events or activities predominates in the clinical presentation With Panic Attacks  This specifier may be used if Panic Attacks  see p  394  predominate in the clinical presentation With Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms  This specifier may be used if obses- sions or compulsions predominate in the clinical presentation With Phobic Symptoms  This specifier may be used if phobic symptoms predominate in the clinical presentation The context of the development of the anxiety symptoms may be indicated by using one of the following specifiers With Onset During Intoxication  This specifier should be used if criteria for intoxication with the substance are met and the symptoms develop during the intoxication syndrome 
Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder 441With Onset During Withdrawal  This specifier should be used if criteria for withdrawal from the substance are met and the symptoms develop during  or shortly after  a withdrawal syndrome Recording ProceduresThe name of the diagnosis of Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder begins with the specific substance  e g   alcohol  methylphenidate  thyroxine  that is presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms  The diagnostic code is selected from the listing of classes of substances provided in the criteria set  For substances that do not fit into any of the classes  e g   thyroxine   the code for "Other Substance" should be used  In addition  for medications prescribed at therapeutic doses  the specific medication can be indicated by listing the appropriate E-code on Axis I  see Appendix G   The name of the disorder  e g   Caffeine-Induced Anxiety Disorder  is followed by the specification of the predominant symptom presentation and the context in which the symptoms developed  e g   292 89 Caffeine-Induced Anxiety Disorder  With Panic Attacks  With Onset During Intoxication   When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symptoms  each should be listed separately  e g   292 89 Cocaine-Induced Anxiety Disorder  With Generalized Anxiety  With Onset During Intoxication  291 8 Alcohol-Induced Anxiety Disorder  With Generalized Anxiety With Onset During Withdrawal   If a substance is judged to be the etiological factor  but the specific substance or class of substances is unknown  the category 292 89 Unknown Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder should be used Specific SubstancesAnxiety Disorders can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances  alcohol  amphetamine and related substances  caffeine  cannabis  cocaine  hallucinogens  inhalants  phencyclidine and related substances  and other or unknown substances  Anxiety Disorders can occur in association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances  alcohol  cocaine  sedatives  hypnotics  and anxiolytics  and other or unknown substances Some of the medications reported to evoke anxiety symptoms include anesthetics and analgesics  sympathomimetics or other bronchodilators  anticholinergics  insulin  thyroid preparations  oral contraceptives  antihistamines  antiparkinsonian medications  corticosteroids  antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications  anticonvulsants  lith- ium carbonate  antipsychotic medications  and antidepressant medications  Heavy metals and toxins  e g   volatile substances such as gasoline and paint  organophosphate insecticides  nerve gases  carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide  may also cause anxiety symptoms Differential DiagnosisAnxiety symptoms commonly occur in Substance Intoxication and Substance With- drawal  The diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation  A diagnosis of Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder should be made instead of a diagnosis of Substance Intoxication or Substance Withdrawal only when the anxiety symptoms are judged to
442 Anxiety Disordersbe in excess of those usually associated with the intoxication or withdrawal syndrome and when the anxiety symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention  For example  anxiety symptoms are a characteristic feature of Alcohol Withdrawal  Alcohol-Induced Anxiety Disorder should be diagnosed instead of Alcohol Withdrawal only if the anxiety symptoms are more severe than those usually encountered with Alcohol Withdrawal and are sufficiently severe to be a separate focus of attention and treatment  If substance-induced anxiety symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium  the anxiety symptoms are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately  In substance-induced presentations that contain a mix of different types of symptoms  e g   mood  psychotic  and anxiety   the specific type of Substance-Induced Disorder to be diagnosed depends on which type of symptoms predominates in the clinical presentation A Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder is distinguished from a prim ary A nxiety Disorderbythefactthatasubstanceisjudgedtobeetiologicallyrelatedtothe symptoms  see p  440  A Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or general medical condition must have its onset while the person is receiving the medication  or during withdrawal  if a withdrawal syndrome is associated with the medication   Once the treatment is discontinued  the anxiety symptoms will usually remit within days to several weeks  depending on the half-life of the substance and the presence of a withdrawal syndrome   If symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks  other causes for the anxiety symptoms should be considered Because individuals with general medical conditions often take medications for those conditions  the clinician must consider the possibility that the anxiety symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the general medical condition rather than the medication  in which case Anxiety Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition is diagnosed  The history often provides the primary basis for such a judgment  At times  a change in the treatment for the general medical condition  e g   medication substitution or discontinuation  may be needed to determine empirically for that person whether or not the medication is the causative agent  If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a general medical condition and substance use  both diagnoses  i e   Anxiety Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition and Substance-Induced AnxietyDisorder  may be given  When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the anxiety symptoms are due to a substance  including a medication  or to a general medical condition or are primary  i e   not due to either a substance or a general medical condition   Anxiety Disorder NotOtherwise Specified would be indicated

Somatoform DisordersThe common feature of the Somatoform Disorders is the presence of physical symptoms that suggest a general medical condition  hence  the term somatoform  and are not fully explained by a general medical condition  by the direct effects of a substance  or by another mental disorder  e g   Panic Disorder   The symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other areas of functioning  In contrast to Factitious Disorders and Malingering  the physical symptoms are not intentional  i e   under voluntary control   Somatoform Disorders differ from Psychological Factors Affecting Medical Condition in that there is no diagnosable general medical condition to fully account for the physical symptoms  The grouping of these disorders in a single section is based on clinical utility  i e   the need to exclude occult general medical conditions or substance-induced etiologies for the bodily symptoms  rather than on assumptions regarding shared etiology or mechanism  These disorders are often encountered in general medical settings The following Somatoform Disorders are included in this section Somatization Disorder  historicallyreferred to as hysteria or Briquet's syndrome  is a polysymptomatic disorder that begins before age 30 years  extends over a period of years  and is characterized by a combination of pain  gastrointestinal  sexual  and pseudoneurological symptoms Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder is characterized by unexplainedphysical complaints  lasting at least 6 months  that are below the threshold for a diagnosis of Somatization Disorder Conversion Disorder involves unexplained symptoms or deficits affecting volun- tary motor or sensory function that suggest a neurological or other general medical condition  Psychological factors are judged to be associated with the symptoms or deficits Pain Disorder is characterized by pain as the predominant focus of clinical attention  In addition  psychological factors are judged to have an important role in its onset  severity  exacerbation  or maintenance Hypochondriasis is the preoccupation with the fear of having  or the idea that one has a serious disease based on the person's misinterpretationof bodily symptoms or bodily functions BodyDysmorphic Disorder isthe preoccupation with an imagined or exaggerated defect in physical appearance Somatoform Disorder Not Otherwise Specified is included for coding disorders with somatoform symptoms that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific Somatoform Disorders 445

300 81 Somatization DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Somatization Disorder is a pattern of recurring  multiple  clinically significant somatic complaints  A somatic complaint is considered to be clinically significant if it results in medical treatment  e g   the taking of medication  or causes significant impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  The somatic complaints must begin before age 30 years and occur over a period of several years  Criterion A   The multiple somatic complaints cannot be fully explained by any known general medical condition or the direct effects of a substance  If they occur in the presence of a general medical condition  the physical complaints or resulting social or occupational impairment are in excess of what would be expected from the history  physical examination  or laboratory tests  Criterion C   There must be a history of pain related to at least four different sites  e g   head  abdomen  back  joints  extremities  chest  rectum  or functions  e g   menstruation  sexual intercourse  urination   Criterion Bl   There also must be a history of at least two gastrointestinal symptoms other than pain  Criterion B2   Most individuals with the disorder describe the presence of nausea and abdominal bloating  Vomiting  diarrhea  and food intolerance are less common  Gastrointestinal complaints often lead to frequent X-ray examinations and can result in abdominal surgery that in retrospect was unnecessary  There must be a history of at least one sexual or reproductive symptom other than pain  Criterion B3   In women  this may consist of irregular menses  menorrhagia  or vomiting throughout pregnancy  In men  there may be symptoms such as erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction  Both women and men may be subject to sexual indifference  Finally  there must also be a history of at least one symptom  other than pain  that suggests a neurological condition  conversion symptoms such as impaired coordination or balance  paralysis or localized weakness  difficulty swallowing or lump in throat  aphonia  urinary retention  hallucinations  loss of touch or pain sensation  double vision  blindness  deafness  or seizures  dissociative symptoms such as amnesia  or loss of consciousness other than fainting   Criterion B4   The symptoms in each of the groups have been listed in the approximate order of their reported frequency  Finally  the unexplained symptoms in Somatization Disorder are not intentionally feigned or produced  as in Factitious Disorder or Malingering   Criterion D  Associated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Individuals with Somati- zation Disorder usually describe their complaints in colorful  exaggerated terms  but specific factual information is often lacking  They are often inconsistent historians  so that a checklist approach to diagnostic interviewing may be less effective than a thorough review of medical treatments and hospitalizations to document a pattern of frequent somatic complaints  They often seek treatment from several physicians concurrently  which may lead to complicated and sometimes hazardous combinations of treatments  Prominent anxiety symptoms and depressed mood are very common and may be the reason for being seen in mental health settings  There may be impulsive and antisocial behavior  suicide threats and attempts  and marital discord  The lives of these individuals  particularly those with associated Personality Disorders  are often as chaotic and complicated as their medical histories  Frequent use of medications may lead to side
300 81 Somatization Disorder 447effects and Substance-Related Disorders  These individuals commonly undergo numer- ous medical examinations  diagnostic procedures  surgeries  and hospitalizations  which expose the person to an increased risk of morbidity associated with these procedures  Major Depressive Disorder  Panic Disorder  and Substance-Related Disorders are fre- quently associated with Somatization Disorder  Histrionic  Borderline  and Antisocial Personality Disorders are the most frequently associated Personality Disorders Associated laboratory findings  Laboratory test results are remarkable for the ab- sence of findings to support the subjective complaints Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions Physical examination is remarkable for the absence of objective findings to fully explain the many subjective complaints of individuals with Somatization Disorder  These individuals may be diagnosed with so-called functional disorders  e g   irritable bowel syndrome   However  because these syndromes are as yet without established objective signs or specific laboratory findings  their symptoms may count toward a diagnosis of Somatization Disorder Specific Culture and Gender FeaturesThe type and frequency of somatic symptoms may differ across cultures  For example  burning hands and feet or the nondelusional experience of worms in the head or ants crawling under the skin represent pseudoneurological symptoms that are more common in Africa and South Asia than in North America  Symptoms related to male reproductive function may be more prevalent in cultures in which there is widespread concern about semen loss  e g   dhat syndrome in India   Accordingly  the symptom reviews should be adjusted to the culture  The symptoms listed in this manual are examples that have been found most diagnostic in the United States  It should be noted that the order of frequency was derived from studies done in the United States Somatization Disorder occurs only rarely in men in the United States  but the higher reported frequency in Greek and Puerto Rican men suggests that cultural factors may influence the sex ratio PrevalenceStudies have reported widely variable lifetime prevalence rates of Somatization Disorder  ranging from 0 2% to 2% among women and less than 0 2% in men  Differences in rates may depend on whether the interviewer is a physician  on the method of assessment  and on the demographic variables in the samples studied  When nonphysician inter- viewers are used  Somatization Disorder is much less frequently diagnosed CourseSomatization Disorder is a chronic but fluctuatingdisorder that rarely remits completely  A year seldom passes without the individual seeking some medical attention prompted by unexplained somatic complaints  Diagnostic criteria are typically met before age 25 years  but initial symptoms are often present by adolescence  Menstrual difficulties may be one of the earliest symptoms in women  Sexual symptoms are often associated with marital discord 
448 Somatoform DisordersFamilial PatternSomatization Disorder is observed in 10%-20% of female first-degree biological relatives of women with Somatization Disorder  The male relatives of women with this disorder show an increased risk of Antisocial Personality Disorder and Substance-Related Disorders  Adoption studies indicate that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the risk for Antisocial Personality Disorder  Substance-Related Disorders  and Somatization Disorder  Having a biological or adoptive parent with any of these disorders increases the risk of developing either Antisocial Personality Disorder  a Substance-Related Disorder  or Somatization Disorder Differential DiagnosisThe symptom picture encountered in Somatization Disorder is frequently nonspecific and can overlap with a multitude of general medical conditions  Three features that suggest a diagnosis of Somatization Disorder rather than a general medical condition include 1  involvement of multiple organ systems  2  early onset and chronic course without development of physical signs or structural abnormalities  and 3  absence of laboratory abnormalities that are characteristic of the suggested general medical condi- tion  It is still necessary to rule out general medical conditions that are characterized by vague  multiple  and confusing somatic symptoms  e g   hyperparathyroidism  acute intermittent porphyria  multiple sclerosis  systemic lupus erythematosus   Moreover  Somatization Disorder does not protect individuals from having other independent general medical conditions  Objective findings should be evaluated without undue reliance on subjective complaints  The onset of multiple physical symptoms late in life is almost always due to a general medical condition Schizophrenia with multiple somatic delusions needs to be differentiated from the nondelusional somatic complaints of individuals with Somatization Disorder  In rare instances  individuals with Somatization Disorder also have Schizophrenia  in which case both diagnoses should be noted  Furthermore  hallucinations can occur as pseudoneuro- logical symptoms and must be distinguished from the typical hallucinations seen in Schizophrenia  see p  275  It can be very difficult to distinguish between Anxiety Disorders and Somatization Disorder  In Panic Disorder  multiple somatic symptoms are also present  but these occur primarily during Panic Attacks  However  Panic Disorder may coexist with Somatization Disorder  when the somatic symptoms occur at times other than during Panic Attacks  both diagnoses may be made  Individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder may have a multitude of physical complaints associated with their generalized anxiety  but the focus of the anxiety and worry is not limited to the physical complaints  Individuals with Mood Disorders  particularly Depressive Disorders  may present with somatic complaints  most commonly headache  gastrointestinal disturbances  or unexplained pain  Individuals with Somatization Disorder have physical complaints recur- rently throughout most of their lives  regardless of their current mood state  whereas physical complaints in Depressive Disorders are limited to episodes of depressed mood  Individuals with Somatization Disorder also often present with depressive complaints  If criteria are met for both Somatization Disorder and a Mood Disorder  both may be diagnosed By definition  all individuals with Somatization Disorder have a history of pain symptoms  sexual symptoms  and conversion or dissociative symptoms  Therefore  if these symptoms occur exclusively during the course of Somatization Disorder  there
300 81 Somatization Disorder 449should not be an additional diagnosis of Pain Disorder Associated With Psycholog- ical Factors  a Sexual Dysfunction  Conversion Disorder  or a Dissociative Disorder  Hypochondriasis is not be diagnosed if preoccupation with fears of having a serious illness occurs exclusively during the course of Somatization Disorder The criteria for Somatization Disorder in this manual are slightly more restrictive than the original criteria for Briquet's syndrome  Somatoform presentations that do not meet criteria for Somatization Disorder should be classified as Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder if the duration of the syndrome is 6 months or longer  or Somatoform Disorder Not Otherwise Specified for presentations of shorter duration InFactitiousDisorderWithPredominantly PhysicalSignsandSymptomsand Malingering  somatic symptoms may be intentionally produced to assume the sick role or for gain  respectively  Symptoms that are intentionally produced should not count toward a diagnosis of Somatization Disorder  However  the presence of some factitious or malingered symptoms  mixed with other nonintentional symptoms  is not uncommon  In such mixed cases  both Somatization Disorder and a Factitious Disorder orMalingering should be diagnosed Diagnostic criteria for 300 81 Somatization DisorderA  A history of many physical complaints beginning before age 30 years that occur over a period of several years and result in treatment being sought or significant impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning B  Each of the following criteria must have been met  with individual symptoms occurring at any time during the course of the disturbance  1  four pain symptoms  a history of pain related to at least four different sites or functions  e g   head  abdomen  back  joints  extremities  chest  rectum  during menstruation  during sexual intercourse  or during urination  2  two gastrointestinal symptoms  a history of at least two gastro- intestinal symptoms other than pain  e g   nausea  bloating  vom iting other than during pregnancy  diarrhea  or intolerance of several different foods  3  one sexual symptom  a history of at least one sexual or reproduc- tive symptom other than pain  e g   sexual indifference  erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction  irregular menses  excessive menstrual bleeding  vomiting throughout pregnancy  4  onepseudoneurological symptom  a history of at least one symp- tom or deficit suggesting a neurological condition not limited to pain  conversion symptoms such as impaired coordination or balance  paralysis or localized weakness  difficulty swallowing or lump in throat  aphonia  urinary retention  hallucinations  loss of touch or pain sensation  double vision  blindness  deafness  sei- zures  dissociative symptoms such as amnesia  or loss of conscious- ness other than fainting  continued

300 81 Undifferentiated Somatoform DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder is one or more physical complaints  Criterion A  that persist for 6 months or longer  Criterion D   The most frequent complaints are chronic fatigue  loss of appetite  or gastrointestinal or genito- urinary symptoms  These symptoms cannot be fully explained by any known general medical condition or the direct effects of a substance  e g   the effects of injury  substance use  or medication side effects   or the physical complaints or resultant impairment are grossly in excess of what would be expected from the history  physical examination  or laboratory findings  Criterion B   The symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion C   The diagnosis is not made when the symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disorder  e g   another Somatoform Disorder  Sexual Dysfunction  Mood Disor- der  Anxiety Disorder  Sleep Disorder  or Psychotic Disorder   Criterion E   The symptoms are not intentionally produced or feigned  as in Factitious Disorder or Malingering   Criterion F  This is a residual category for those persistent somatoform presentations that do not meet the full criteria for Somatization Disorder or another Somatoform Disorder  Symptoms that may be seen include the examples listed for Somatization Disorder  There may be a single circumscribed symptom  such as nausea  or  more commonly  multiple physical symptoms  The chronic unexplained physical complaints often lead to medical consultation  typically with a primary care physician Specific Culture  Age  and GenderFeaturesMedically unexplained symptoms and worry about physical illness may constitute culturally shaped "idioms of distress" that are employed to express concerns about a
300 81 Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder 451broad range of personal and social problems  without necessarily indicating psycho- pathology  The highest frequency of unexplained physical complaints occurs in young women of low socioeconomic status  but such symptoms are not limited to any age  gender  or sociocultural group  "Neurasthenia " a syndrome described frequently in many parts of the world and characterized by fatigue and weakness  is classified in DSM-IV as Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder if symptoms have persisted for longer than 6 months CourseThe course of individual unexplained physical complaints is unpredictable  The eventual diagnosis of a general medical condition or another mental disorder is frequent Differential DiagnosisAlso refer to the "Differential Diagnosis" section for Somatization Disorder  see p 448   Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder is differentiated from Somatization Disorder by the requirement in Somatization Disorder of a multiplicity of symptoms of several years' duration and an onset before age 30 years  Individuals with Somatization Disorder are typically inconsistent historians  so that at one evaluation they may report many symptoms that fulfill criteria for Somatization Disorder  whereas at another time they may report many fewer symptoms that fail to meet full criteria  If the physical complaints have persisted for less than 6 months  a diagnosis of Somatoform Disorder Not Otherwise Specified should be made  Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disorder  Other mental disorders that frequently include unexplained physical complaints are Major Depressive Disorder  Anxiety Disorders  and Adjustment Disorder  In contrast to Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder  the physical symptoms of Factitious Disorders and Malingering are intentionally produced or feigned  In Factitious Disorder  the motivation is to assume the sick role and to obtain medical evaluation and treatment  whereas in Malingering  more external incentives are apparent  such as financial compensation  avoidance of duty  evasion of criminal prosecution  or obtaining drugs Diagnostic criteria for 300 81 Undifferentiated Somatoform DisorderA  One or more physical complaints  e g   fatigue  loss of appetite  gastro- intestinal or urinary complaints  B  Either 1 or 2   1  after appropriate investigation  the symptoms cannot be fully explained by a known general medical condition or the direct effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  continued

300 11 Conversion DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Conversion Disorder is the presence of symptoms or deficits affecting voluntary motor or sensory function that suggest a neurological or other general medical condition  Criterion A   Psychological factors are judged to be associated with the symptom or deficit  a judgment based on the observation that the initiation or exacerbation of the symptom or deficit is preceded by conflicts or other stressors  Criterion B   The symptoms are not intentionally produced or feigned  as in Factitious Disorder or Malingering  Criterion C   Conversion Disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms or deficits are fully explained by a neurological or other general medical condition  by the direct effects of a substance  or as a culturally sanctioned behavior or experience  Criterion D   The problem must be clinically significant as evidenced by marked distress  impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  or the fact that it warrants medical evaluation  Criterion E   Conversion Disorder is not diagnosed if symptoms are limited to pain or sexual dysfunction  occur exclusively during the course of Somatization Disorder  or are better accounted for by another mental disorder  Criterion F  Conversion symptoms are related to voluntary motor or sensory functioning and are thus referred to as "pseudoneurological " Motor symptoms or deficits include impaired coordination or balance  paralysis or localized weakness  aphonia  difficulty swallowing or a sensation of a lump in the throat  and urinary retention  Sensory symptoms or deficits include loss of touch or pain sensation  double vision  blindness  deafness  and hallucinations  Symptoms may also include seizures or convulsions  The more medically naive the person  the more implausible are the presenting symptoms  More sophisticated
persons tend to have more subtle symptoms and deficits that may closely simulate neurological or other general medical conditions A diagnosis of Conversion Disorder should be made only after a thorough medical investigation has been performed to rule out an etiological neurological or general medical condition  Because a general medical etiology for many cases of apparent Conversion Disorder can take years to become evident  the diagnosis should be viewed as tentative and provisional  In early studies  general medical etiologies were later found in from one-quarter to one-half of persons initially diagnosed with conversion symptoms  In more recent studies  misdiagnosis is less evident  perhaps reflecting increased awareness of the disorder  as well as improved knowledge and diagnostic techniques  A history of other unexplained somatic  especially conversion  or dissociative symptoms signifies a greater likelihood that an apparent conversion symptom is not due to a general medical condition  especially if criteria for Somatization Disorder have been met in the past Conversion symptoms typically do not conform to known anatomical pathways and physiological mechanisms  but instead follow the individual's conceptualization of a condition  A "paralysis" may involve inability to perform a particular movement or to move an entire body part  rather than a deficit corresponding to patterns of motor innervation  Conversion symptoms are often inconsistent  A "paralyzed" extremity will be moved inadvertently while dressing or when attention is directed elsewhere  If placed above the head and released  a "paralyzed" arm will briefly retain its position  then fall to the side  rather than striking the head  Unacknowledged strength in antagonistic muscles  normal muscle tone  and intact reflexes may be demonstrated  An electro- myogram will be normal  Difficulty swallowing will be equal with liquids and solids  Conversion "anesthesia" of a foot or a hand may follow a so-called stocking-glove distribution with uniform  no proximal to distal gradient  loss of all sensory modalities  i e   touch  temperature  and pain  sharply demarcated at an anatomical landmark rather than according to dermatomes  A conversion "seizure" will vary from convulsion to convulsion  and paroxysmal activity will not be evident on an EEG Even when following such guidelines carefully  caution must be exercised  Knowl- edge of anatomical and physiological mechanisms is incomplete and available methods of objective assessment have limitations  A broad range of neurological conditions may be misdiagnosed as Conversion Disorder  Prominent among them are multiple sclerosis  myasthenia gravis  and idiopathic or substance-induced dystonias  However  the pres- ence of a neurological condition does not preclude a diagnosis of Conversion Disorder  As many as one-third of individuals with conversion symptoms have a current or prior neurological condition  Conversion Disorder may be diagnosed in the presence of a neurological or other general medical condition if the symptoms are not fully explained given the nature and severity of the neurological or other general medical condition Traditionally  the term conversion derived from the hypothesis that the individual's somatic symptom represents a symbolic resolution of an unconscious psychological conflict  reducing anxiety and serving to keep the conflict out of awareness  "primary gain"   The individual might also derive "secondary gain" from the conversion symp- tomâ€”that is  external benefits are obtained or noxious duties or responsibilities are evaded  Although the DSM-IV criteria set for Conversion Disorder does not necessarily imply that the symptoms involve such constructs  it does require that psychological factors be associated with their onset or exacerbation  Because psychological factors are so ubiquitously present in relation to general medical conditions  it can be difficult to establish whether a specific psychological factor is etiologically related to the symptom or deficit  However  a close temporal relationship between a conflict or stressor and the300 11 Conversion Disorder 453
454 Somatoform Disordersinitiation or exacerbation of a symptom may be helpful in this determination  especially if the person has developed conversion symptoms under similar circumstances in the past Although the individual may derive secondary gain from the conversion symptom  unlike in Malingeringor FactitiousDisorder the symptoms are not intentionally produced to obtain the benefits  The determination that a symptom is not intentionally produced or feigned can also be difficult  Generally  it must be inferred from a careful evaluation of the context in which the symptom develops  especially relative to potential external rewards or the assumption of the sick role  Supplementing the person's self-report with additional sources of information  e g   from associates or records  may be helpful Conversion Disorder is not diagnosed if a symptom is fully explained as aculturally sanctioned behavior or experience  For example  "visions" or "spells" that occur as part of religious rituals in which such behaviors are encouraged and expected would not justify a diagnosis of Conversion Disorder unless the symptom exceeded what is contextually expected and caused undue distress or impairment  In "epidemic hysteria " shared symptoms develop in a circumscribed group of people following "exposure" to a common precipitant  A diagnosis of Conversion Disorder should be made only if the individual experiences clinically significant distress or impairment SubtypesThe following subtypes are noted based on the nature of the presenting symptom or deficit With Motor Symptom or Deficit  This subtype includes such symptoms as impaired coordination or balance  paralysis or localized weakness  difficulty swallowing or "lump in throat " aphonia  and urinary retention With Sensory Symptom or Deficit  This subtype includes such symptoms as loss of touch or pain sensation  double vision  blindness  deafness  and halluci- nations With Seizures or Convulsions  This subtype includes seizures or convulsions with voluntary motor or sensory components With Mixed Presentation  This subtype is used if symptoms of more than one category are evident Associated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Individuals with conver- sion symptoms may show la belle indifference  i e   a relative lack of concern about the nature or implications of the symptom  or may also present in a dramatic or histrionic fashion  Because these individuals are often suggestible  their symptoms may be modified or resolved based on external cues  however  it must be cautioned that this is not specific to Conversion Disorder and may also occur with general medical conditions  Symptoms may be more common following extreme psychosocial stress  e g   warfare or the recent death of a significant figure   Dependency and the adoption of a sick role may be fostered in the course of treatment  Other nonconversion somatic complaints are common  Associated mental disorders include Dissociative Disorders  Major Depres- sive Disorder  and Histrionic  Antisocial  and Dependent Personality Disorders 
Associated laboratory findings  No specific laboratory abnormalities are associated with Conversion Disorder  In fact  it is the absence of expected findings that suggests and supports the diagnosis of Conversion Disorder  However  laboratory findings consistent with a general medical condition do not exclude the diagnosis of Conversion Disorder  because it only requires that a symptom not be fully explained by such a condition Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions Symptoms of Conversion Disorder typically do not conform to known anatomical pathways and physiological mechanisms  Thus  expected objective signs  e g   reflex changes  are rarely present  However  a person may develop symptoms that resemble those observed in others or in themselves  e g   individuals with epilepsy may simulate "seizures" that resemble those they have observed in others or how their own seizures were described to them   Generally  individual conversion symptoms are self-limited and do not lead to physical changes or disabilities  Rarely  physical changes such as atrophy and contractures may occur as a result of disuse or as sequelae to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures  It is important to note  however  that conversion symptoms can occur in individuals with neurological conditions Specific Culture  Age  and Gender FeaturesConversion Disorder has been reported to be more common in rural populations  individuals of lower socioeconomic status  and individuals less knowledgeable about medical and psychological concepts  Higher rates of conversion symptoms are reported in developing regions  with the incidence generally declining with increasing develop- ment  Falling down with loss or alteration of consciousness is a feature of a variety of culture-specific syndromes  The form of conversion symptoms reflects local cultural ideas about acceptable and credible ways to express distress  Changes resembling conversion symptoms  as well as dissociative symptoms  are common aspects of certain culturally sanctioned religious and healing rituals  The clinician must assess 'whether such symptoms are fully explained in the particular social context  and whether they result in clinically significant distress  disability  or role impairment Conversion symptoms in children under age 10 years are usually limited to gait problems or seizures  Conversion Disorder appears to be more frequent in women than in m e n   with reported ratios varying from 2 1 to 10 1  Especially in women  symptom are much more common on the left than on the right side of the body  Women  rarely men  presenting with conversion symptoms may later manifest the full picture of Somatization Disorder  Particularly in men an association with AntisocialPersonality Disorder is evident  In men  Conversion Disorder is often seen in the context ofindustrial accidents or the military  in which cases it must be carefully differentiated from Malingering PrevalenceReported rates of Conversion Disorder have varied widely  ranging from 11/100 000 to 300/100 000 in general population samples  It has been reported as a focus of treatment in l%-3% of outpatient referrals to mental health clinics 300 11 Conversion Disorder 455
456 Somatoform DisordersCourseThe onset of Conversion Disorder is generally from late childhood to early adulthood  rarely before age 10 years or after age 35 years  but onset as late as the ninth decade of life has been reported  When an apparent Conversion Disorder first develops in middle or old age the probability of an occult neurological or other general medical condition is high  The onset of Conversion Disorder is generally acute  but gradually increasing symptomatology may also occur  Typically  individual conversion symptoms are of short duration  In individuals hospitalized with conversion symptoms  symptoms will remit within 2 weeks in most cases  Recurrence is common  occurring in from one-fifth to one-quarter of individuals within 1 year  with a single recurrence predicting future episodes  Factors that are associated with good prognosis include acute onset  presence of clearly identifiable stress at the time of onset  a short interval between onset and the institution of treatment  and above average intelligence  Symptoms of paralysis  aphonia  and blindness are associated with a good prognosis  whereas tremor and seizures arenot Familial PatternLimited data suggest that conversion symptoms are more frequent in relatives of individuals with Conversion Disorder  Increased risk of Conversion Disorder in mono- zygotic but not in dizygotic twin pairs has been reported Differential DiagnosisThe major diagnostic concern in evaluating potential conversion symptoms is the exclusion of occult neurological or other general medical conditions and sub- stance  including medication -induced etiologies  Appropriate evaluation of po- tential general medical conditions  e g   multiple sclerosis  myasthenia gravis  should include careful review of the current presentation  the overall medical history  neuro- logical and general physical examinations  and appropriate laboratory studies  including investigation for use of alcohol and other substances Pain Disorder or a Sexual Dysfunction is diagnosed instead of Conversion Disorder if the symptoms are limited to pain or to sexual dysfunction  respectively  An additional diagnosis of Conversion Disorder should not be made if conversion symptoms occur exclusively during the course of Somatization Disorder  Conversion Disorder is not diagnosed if symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disorder  e g   catatonic symptoms or somatic delusions in Schizophrenia or other Psychotic Disorders or Mood Disorder or difficulty swallowing during a Panic Attack   In Hypochondriasis  the individual is preoccupied with the "serious disease" underlying the pseudoneurological symptoms  whereas in Conversion Disorder the focus is on the presenting symptom and there may be la belle indifference  In Body Dysmorphic Disorder  the emphasis is on a preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in appearance  rather than a change in voluntary motor or sensory function  Conversion Disorder shares features with Dissociative Disorders  Both disorders involve symptoms that suggest neurological dysfunction and may also have shared antecedents  If both conversion and dissociative symptoms occur in the same individual  which is common   both diagnoses should be made Itiscontroversialwhetherhallucinations "pseudohallucinations" canbe considered as the presenting symptom of Conversion Disorder  As distinguished from hallucina-
tions that occur in the context of a Psychotic Disorder  e g   Schizophrenia or another Psychotic Disorder  a Psychotic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition  a Substance-Related Disorder  or a Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features   hallucina- tions in Conversion Disorder generally occur with intact insight in the absence of other psychotic symptoms  often involve more than one sensory modality  e g   a hallucination involving visual  auditory  and tactile components   and often have a naive  fantastic  or childish content  They are often psychologically meaningful and tend to be described by the individual as an interesting story Symptoms of Factitious Disorders and Malingering are intentionally produced or feigned  In Factitious Disorder  the motivation is to assume the sick role and to obtain medical evaluation and treatment  whereas more obvious goals such as financial compensation  avoidance of duty  evasion of criminal prosecution  or obtaining drugs are apparent in Malingering  Such goals may resemble "secondary gain" in conversion symptoms  with the distinguishing feature of conversion symptoms being the lack of conscious intent in the production of the symptom I Diagnostic criteria for 300 11 Conversion DisorderA  One or more symptoms or deficits affecting voluntary motor or sensory function that suggest a neurological or other general medical condition B  Psychological factors are judged to be associated with the symptom or deficit because the initiation or exacerbation of the symptom or deficit is preceded by conflicts or other stressors C  The symptom or deficit is not intentionally produced or feigned  as in Factitious Disorder orMalingering  D  The symptom or deficit cannot  after appropriate investigation  be fully explained by a general medical condition  or by the direct effects of a substance  or as a culturally sanctioned behavior or experience E  The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or impair- ment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning or warrants medical evaluation F  The symptom or deficit is not limited to pain or sexual dysfunction  does not occur exclusively during the course of Somatization Disorder  and is not better accounted for by another mental disorder Specify type of symptom or deficit With Motor Symptom or Deficit With Sensory Symptom or Deficit With Seizures or Convulsions With Mixed Presentation300 11 Conversion Disorder 457
458 Somatoform Disorders
***300 7 HypochondriasisDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Hypochondriasis is preoccupation with fears of having  or the idea that one has  a serious disease based on a misinterpretation of one or more bodily signs or symptoms  Criterion A   A thorough medical evaluation does not identify a general medical condition that fully accounts for the person's concerns about disease or for the physical signs or symptoms  although a coexisting general medical condition
may be present   The unwarranted fear or idea of having a disease persists despite medical reassurance  Criterion B   However  the belief is not of delusional intensity  i e   the person can acknowledge the possibility that he or she may be exaggerating the extent of the feared disease  or that there may be no disease at all  The belief is also not restricted to a circumscribed concern about appearance  as seen in Body Dysmorphic Disorder  Criterion C   The preoccupation with bodily symptoms causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion D  and lasts for at least 6 months  Criterion E   The preoccupation is not better accounted for by Generalized Anxiety Disorder  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  Panic Disorder  a Major Depressive Episode  Separation Anxiety  or another Somatoform Disorder  Criterion F  The preoccupation in Hypochondriasis may be with bodily functions  e g   heartbeat  sweating  or peristalsis   with minor physical abnormalities  e g   a small sore or an occasional cough   or with vague and ambiguous physical sensations  e g   "tired heart " "aching veins"   The person attributes these symptoms or signs to the suspected disease and is very concerned with their meaning  authenticity  and etiology  The concerns may involve several body systems  at different times or simultaneously  Alternatively  there may be preoccupation with a specific organ or a single disease  e g   fear of having cardiac disease   Repeated physical examinations  diagnostic tests  and reassurance from the physician do little to allay the concern about bodily disease or affliction  For example  an individual preoccupied with having cardiac disease will not be reassured by the repeated lack of findings on physical examination  ECG or even cardiac angiography  Individuals with Hypochondriasis may become alarmed by reading or hearing about disease  knowing someone who becomes sick  or from observations  sensations  or occurrences within their own bodies  Concern about the feared illness often becomes a central feature of the individual's self-image  a topic of social discourse  and a response to life stresses SpecifierWith Poor Insight  This specifier is used if  for most of the time during the current episode  the individual does not recognize that the concern about having a serious illness is excessive or unreasonable 300 7 Body Dysmorphic DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Body Dysmorphic Disorder  historically known as dys- morphophobia  is a preoccupation with a defect in appearance  Criterion A   The defect is either imagined  or  if a slight physical anomaly is present  the individual's concern is markedly excessive  Criterion A   The preoccupation must cause significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion B   The preoccupation is not better accounted for by another mental disorder  e g   dissatisfaction with body shape and size in Anorexia Nervosa   CriterionC  Complaints commonly involve imagined or slight flaws of the face or head such as hair thinning  acne  wrinkles  scars  vascular markings  paleness or redness of the complexion  swelling  facial asymmetry or disproportion  or excessive facial hair  Other common preoccupations include the shape  size  or some other aspect of the nose  eyes  eyelids  eyebrows  ears  mouth  lips  teeth  jaw  chin  cheeks  or head  However  any other body part may be the focus of concern  e g   the genitals  breasts  buttocks  abdomen  arms  hands  feet  legs  hips  shoulders  spine  larger body regions  or overall body size   The preoccupation may simultaneously focus on several body parts  Although the complaint is often specific  e g   a "crooked" lip or a "bumpy" nose   it is sometimes vague  e g   a "falling" face or "inadequately firm" eyes   Because of embarrassment over their concerns  some individualswith Body Dysmorphic Disorder avoid describing their "defects" in detail and may instead refer only to their general ugliness Most individuals with this disorder experience marked distress over their supposed deformity  often describing their preoccupations as "intensely painful " "tormenting " or "devastating " Most find their preoccupations difficult to control  and they may make little or no attempt to resist them  As a result  they often spend hours a day thinking about their "defect " to the point where these thoughts may dominate their lives  Significant impairment in many areas of functioning generally occurs  Feelings of self-consciousness about their "defect" may lead to avoidance of work or public situations 300 12 Dissociative Amnesia formerly Psychogenic Amnesia  Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Dissociative Amnesia is an inability to recall important personal information  usually of a traumatic or stressful nature  that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness  Criterion A   This disorder involves a reversible memory impairment in which memories of personal experience cannot be retrieved in a verbal form  or  if temporarily retrieved  cannot be wholly retained in consciousness   The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of Dissociative Identity Disorder  Dissociative Fugue  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  Acute Stress Disorder  or Somatization Disorder and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a neurological or other general medical condition  Criterion B   The symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion C  Dissociative Amnesia most commonly presents as a retrospectively reported gap or series of gaps in recall for aspects of the individual's life history  These gaps are usually related to traumatic or extremely stressful events  Some individuals may have amnesia for episodes of self-mutilation  violent outbursts  or suicide attempts  Less commonly  Dissociative Amnesia presents as a florid episode with sudden onset  This acute form is more likely to occur during wartime or in response to a natural disaster Several types of memory disturbances have been described in Dissociative Amnesia  In localized amnesia  the individual fails to recall events that occurred during a circumscribed period of time  usually the first few hours following a profoundly disturbing event  e g   the uninjured survivor of a car accident in which a family member has been killed may not be able to recall anything that happened from the time of the accident until 2 days later   In selective amnesia  the person can recall some  but not all  of the events during a circumscribed period of time  e g   a combat veteran can recall only some parts of a series of violent combat experiences   Three other types of amnesiaâ€”generalized  continuous  and systematizedâ€”are less common  In generalized amnesia  failure of recall encompasses the person's entire life  Individuals with this rare disorder usually present to the police  to emergency rooms  or to general hospital consultation-liaison services  Continuous amnesia is defined as the inability to recall events subsequent to a specific time up to and including the present  Systematized amnesia is loss of memory for certain categories of information  such as all memories relating to one's family or to a particular person  Individuals who exhibit these latter three types of Dissociative Amnesia may ultimately be diagnosed as having a more complex form of Dissociative Disorder  e g   Dissociative Identity Disorder  
300 13 Dissociative Fugue  formerly Psychogenic Fugue Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Dissociative Fugue is sudden  unexpected  travel away from home or one's customary place of daily activities  with inability to recall some or all of one's past  Criterion A   This is accompanied by confusion about personal identity or even the assumption of a new identity  Criterion B   The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of Dissociative Identity Disorder and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition  Criterion C   The symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion D  Travel may range from brief trips over relatively short periods of time  i e   hours or days  to complex  usually unobtrusive wandering over long time periods  e g   weeks or months   with some individuals reportedly crossing numerous national borders and traveling thousands of miles  During a fugue  individuals generally appear to be without psychopathology and do not attract attention  At some point  the individual is brought to clinical attention  usually because of amnesia for recent events or a lack of awareness of personal identity  Once the individual returns to the prefugue state  there may be no memory for the events that occurred during the fugue Most fugues do not involve the formation of a new identity  If a new identity is assumed during a fugue  it is usually characterized by more gregarious and uninhibited traits than characterized the former identity  The person may assume a new name  take up a new residence  and engage in complex social activities that are well integrated and that do not suggest the presence of a mental disorder 300 14 Dissociative Identity Disorder formerly Multiple Personality Disorder  Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Dissociative Identity Disorder is the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states  Criterion A  that recurrently take control of behavior  Criterion B   There is an inability to recall important personal information  the extent of which is too great to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness  Criterion C   The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition  Criterion D   In children  the symptoms cannot be attributed to imaginary playmates or other fantasy play Dissociative Identity Disorder reflects a failure to integrate various aspects of identity  memory  and consciousness  Each personality state may be experienced as if it has a distinct personal history  self-image  and identity  including a separate name  Usually there is a primary identity that carries the individual's given name and is passive  dependent  guilty  and depressed  The alternate identities frequently have different names and characteristics that contrast with the primary identity  e g   are hostile  controlling  and self-destructive   Particular identities may emerge in specific circum- stances and may differ in reported age and gender  vocabulary  general knowledge  or predominant affect  Alternate identities are experienced as taking control in sequence  one at the expense of the other  and may deny knowledge of one another  be critical of one another  or appear to be in open conflict  Occasionally  one or more powerful identities allocate time to the others  Aggressive or hostile identities may at times interrupt activities or place the others in uncomfortable situations Individuals with this disorder experience frequent gaps in memory for personal history  both remote and recent  The amnesia is frequently asymmetrical  The more passive identities tend to have more constricted memories  whereas the more hostile  controlling  or "protector" identities have more complete memories  An identity that is not in control may nonetheless gain access to consciousness by producing auditory or visual hallucinations  e g   a voice giving instructions   Evidence of amnesia may be uncovered by reports from others who have witnessed behavior that is disavowed by the individual or by the individual's own discoveries  e g   finding items of clothing at home that the individual cannot remember having bought   There may be loss of memory not only for recurrent periods of time  but also an overall loss of biographical memory for some extended period of childhood  Transitions among identities are often triggered by psychosocial stress  The time required to switch from one identity to another is usually a matter of seconds  but  less frequently  may be gradual  The number of identities reported ranges from 2 to more than 100  Half of reported cases include individuals with10 or fewer identities 
300 6 Depersonalizetion DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of Depersonalization Disorder are persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization characterized by a feeling of detachment or estrangement from one's self  Criterion A   The individual may feel like an automaton or as if he or she is living in a dream or a movie  There may be a sensation of being an outside observer of one's mental processes  one's body  or parts of one's body  Various types of sensory anesthesia  lack of affective response  and a sensation of lacking control of one's actions  including speech  are often present  The individual with Depersonalization Disorder maintains intact reality testing  e g   awareness that it is only a feeling and that he or she is not really an automaton   Criterion B   Depersonalization is a common experience  and this diagnosis should be made only if the symptoms are sufficiently severe to cause marked distress or impairment in functioning  Criterion C   Because depersonalization is a common associated feature of many other mental disorders  a separate diagnosis of Depersonalization Disorder is not made if the experience occurs exclusively during the course of another mental disorder  e g   Schizophrenia  Panic Disorder  Acute Stress Disorder  or another Dissociative Disorder   In addition  the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition  Criterion D  300 15 Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise SpecifiedThis category is included for disorders in which the predominant feature is a dissociative symptom  i e   a disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness  memory  identity  or perception of the environment  that does not meet the criteria for any specific Dissociative Disorder  Examples include1  Clinical presentations similar to Dissociative Identity Disorder that fail to meet full criteria for this disorder  Examples include presentations in which a  there are not two or more distinct personality states  or b  amnesia for important personal information does not occur 2  Derealization unaccompanied by depersonalization in adults 3  States of dissociation that occur in individuals who have been subjected to periods of prolonged and intense coercive persuasion  e g   brainwashing thought reform  or indoctrination while captive  4  Dissociative trance disorder  single or episodic disturbances in the state ofconsciousness  identity  or memory that are indigenous to particular locations and cultures  Dissociative trance involves narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or stereotyped behaviors or movements that are experienced as being beyond one's control  Possession trance involves replacement of the customary sense of personal identity by a new identity  attributed to the influence of a spirit  power  deity  or other person  and associated with stereotyped "involuntary" movements or amnesia  Examples include amok  Indonesia   bebainan  Indonesia   latah  Malaysia   pibloktoq  Arctic   ataque de nervios  Latin America   and possession  India   The dissociative or trance disorder is
302 71 Hypoactive Sexual Desire DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder is a deficiency or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity  Criterion A   The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty  Criterion B   The dysfunction is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder  except another Sexual Dysfunction  and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance  including medications  or a general medical condition  Criterion C   Low sexual desire may be global and encompass all forms of sexual expression or may be situational and limited to one partner or to a specific sexual activity  e g   intercourse but not masturbation   There is little motivation to seek stimuli and diminished frustration when deprived of the opportunity for sexual expression  The individual usually does not initiate sexual activity or may only engage in it reluctantly when it is initiated by the partner  Although the frequency of sexual experiences is usually low  pressure from the partner or nonsexual needs  e g   for physical comfort or intimacy  may increase the frequency of sexual encounters  Because of a lack of normative age- or gender-related data on frequency or degree of sexual desire  the diagnosis must rely on clinicaljudgment based on the individual's characteristics  the interpersonal determinants  the life context  and the cultural setting  The clinician may need to assess both partners when discrepancies in sexual desire prompt the call for professional attention  Apparent "low desire" in one partner may instead reflect an excessive need for sexual expression by the other partner  Alternatively  both partners may have levels of desire within the normal range but at different ends of the continuum 
302 79 Sexual Aversion Disorder 499 302 79 Sexual Aversion DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Sexual Aversion Disorder is the aversion to and active avoidance of genital sexual contact with a sexual partner  Criterion A   The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty  Criterion B   The dysfunction is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder  except another Sexual Dysfunction   Criterion C   The individual reports anxiety  fear  or disgust when confronted by a sexual opportunity with a partner  The aversion to genital contact may be focused on a particular aspect of sexual experience  e g   genital secretions  vaginal penetration   Some individuals experience generalized revulsion to all sexual stimuli  including kissing and touching  The intensity of the individual's reaction when exposed to the aversive stimulus may range from moderate anxiety and lack of pleasure to extreme psychological distress 302 72 Female Sexual Arousal DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Female Sexual Arousal Disorder is a persistent or recurrent inability to attain  or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity  an adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement  Criterion A   The arousal response consists of vasocongestion in the pelvis  vaginal lubrication and expansion  and swelling of the external genitalia  The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty  Criterion B   The dysfunction is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder  except another Sexual Dysfunction  and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance  including medications  or a general medical condition  Criterion C  302 72 Male Erectile DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Male Erectile Disorder is a persistent or recurrent inability to attain  or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity  an adequate erection  Criterion A   The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty  Criterion B   The dysfunction is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder  except another Sexual Dysfunction  and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance  including medications  or a general medical condition  Crite- rion C  There are different patterns of erectile dysfunction  Some individuals will report the inability to obtain any erection from the outset of a sexual experience  Others will complain of first experiencing an adequate erection and then losing tumescence when attempting penetration  Still others will report that they have an erection that is sufficiently firm for penetration but that they then lose tumescence before or during thrusting  Some males may report being able to experience an erection only during self-masturbation or on awakening  Masturbatory erections may be lost as well  but this is not common 
302 73 Female Orgasmic Disorder  formerly Inhibited Female Orgasm Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Female Orgasmic Disorder is a persistent or recurrent delay in  or absence of  orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase  Criterion A   Women exhibit wide variability in the type or intensity of stimulation that triggers orgasm  The diagnosis of Female Orgasmic Disorder should be based on the clinician's judgment that the woman's orgasmic capacity is less than would be reasonable for her age  sexual experience  and the adequacy of sexual stimulation she receives  The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty  Criterion B   The dysfunction is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder  except another Sexual Dysfunction  and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance  including medications  or a general medical condition  CriterionC  302 74 Male Orgasmic Disorder formerly Inhibited Male Orgasm Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Male Orgasmic Disorder is a persistent or recurrent delay in  or absence of  orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase  In judging whether the orgasm is delayed  the clinician should take into account the person's age and whether the stimulation is adequate in focus  intensity  and duration  Criterion A   The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty  Criterion B   The orgasmic dysfunction is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder  except another Sexual Dysfunction  and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance  including medications  or a general medical condition  Criterion C   In the most common form of Male Orgasmic Disorder  a male cannot reach orgasm during intercourse  although he can ejaculate from a partner's manual or oral stimulation  Some males with Male Orgasmic Disorder can reach coital orgasm but only after very prolonged and intense noncoital stimulation  Some can ejaculate only from masturbation  An even smaller subgroup have experienced orgasm only at the moment of waking from an erotic dream 
302 75 Premature EjaculationDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Premature Ejaculation is the persistent or recurrent onset of orgasm and ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before  on  or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it  Criterion A   The clinician must take into account factors that affect duration of the excitement phase  such as age  novelty of the sexual partner or situation  and recent frequency of sexual activity  The majority of males with this disorder can delay orgasm during self-masturbation for a considerably longer time than during coitus  Partners' estimates of the duration of time from the beginning of sexual activity until ejaculation as well as their judgment of whether Premature Ejaculation is a problem can be quite disparate  The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty  Criterion B   The premature ejaculation is not due exclusively to the direct effects of a substance  e g   withdrawal from opioids   Criterion C  
302 76 Dyspareunia Not Due to a General Medical Condition Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Dyspareunia is genital pain that is associated with sexual intercourse  Criterion A   Although it is most commonly experienced during coitus  it may also occur before or after intercourse  The disorder can occur in both males and females  In females  the pain may be described as superficial during intromission or as deep during penile thrusting  The intensity of the symptoms may range from mild discomfort to sharp pain  The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty  Criterion B   The disturbance is not caused exclusively by Vaginismus or lack of lubrication  is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder  except for another Sexual Dysfunction   and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition  CriterionC  
306 51 Vaginismus Not Due to a General Medical Condition Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Vaginismus is the recurrent or persistent involuntary contraction of the perineal muscles surrounding the outer third of the vagina when vaginal penetration with penis  finger  tampon  or speculum is attempted  Criterion A   The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty  Criterion B   The disturbance is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder  except another Sexual Dysfunction  and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition  Criterion C   In some females  even the anticipation of vaginal insertion may result in muscle spasm  The contraction may range from mild  inducing some tightness and discomfort  to severe  preventing penetration 
Sexual Dysfunction Due to a General Medical ConditionDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Sexual Dysfunction Due to a General Medical Condition is the presence of clinically significant sexual dysfunction that is judged to be due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition  The sexual dysfunction can involve pain associated with intercourse  hypoactive sexual desire  male erectile dysfunction  or other forms of sexual dysfunction  e g   Orgasmic Disorders  and must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty  Criterion A   There must be evidence from the history  physical examination  or laboratory findings that the dysfunction is fully explained by the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition  Criterion B   The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder  e g   Major Depressive Disorder   CriterionC  In determining whether the sexual dysfunction is exclusively due to a general medical condition  the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical condition  Further the clinician must establish that the sexual dysfunction isetiologically related to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism  A careful and comprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment  Although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the sexual dysfunction and the general medical condition is etiological  several considerations provide some guidance in this area  One consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset  exacerbation  or remission of the general
516 Sexual and Gender Identity Disordersmedical condition and that of the sexual dysfunction  A second consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of a primary Sexual Dysfunction  e g   atypical age at onset or course   Evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a direct association between the general medical condition in question and the development of the sexual dysfunction can provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation  In addition  the clinician must also judge that the disturbance is not better accounted for by a primary Sexual Dysfunction  a Substance-Induced Sexual Dysfunction  or another primary mental disorder  e g   Major Depressive Disorder   These determinations are explained in greater detail in the "Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition" section  p  165  In contrast  a Sexual Dysfunction diagnosis with the subtype "Due to Combined Factors" is made if a combination of psychological factors and either a general medical condition or a substance is judged to have an etiological role  but no one etiology is sufficient to account for the dysfunction 302 70 Sexual Dysfunction Not Otherwise SpecifiedThis category includes sexual dysfunctions that do not meet criteria for any specific Sexual Dysfunction  Examples include1  No  or substantially diminished  subjective erotic feelings despite otherwise- normal arousal and orgasm2  Situations in which the clinician has concluded that a sexual dysfunction is present but is unable to determine whether it is primary  due to a general medical condition  or substance inducedParaphiliasDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of a Paraphilia are recurrent  intense sexually arousing fantasies  sexual urges  or behaviors generally involving 1  nonhuman objects  2  the suffering or
humiliation of oneself or one's partner  or 3  children or other nonconsenting persons  that occur over a period of at least 6 months  Criterion A   For some individuals  paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli are obligatory for erotic arousal and are always included in sexual activity  In other cases  the paraphiliac preferences occur only episodically  e g   perhaps during periods of stress   whereas at other times the person is able to function sexually without paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli  The behavior  sexual urges  or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion B  Paraphiliac imagery may be acted out with a nonconsenting partner in a way that may be injurious to the partner  as in Sexual Sadism or Pedophilia   The individual may be subject to arrest and incarceration  Sexual offenses against children constitute a significant proportion of all reported criminal sex acts  and individuals with Exhibition- ism  Pedophilia  and Voyeurism make up the majority of apprehended sex offenders  In some situations  acting out the paraphiliac imagery may lead to self-injury  as in Sexual Masochism   Social and sexual relationships may suffer if others find the unusual sexual behavior shameful or repugnant or if the individual's sexual partner refuses to cooperate in the unusual sexual preferences  In some instances  the unusual behavior  e g   exhibitionistic acts or the collection of fetish objects  may become the major sexual activity in the individual's life  These individuals are rarely self-referred and usually come to the attention of mental health professionals only when their behavior has brought them into conflict with sexual partners or society The Paraphilias described here are conditions that have been specifically identified by previous classifications  They include Exhibitionism  exposure of genitals   Fetishism  use of nonliving objects   Frotteurism  touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person   Pedophilia  focus on prepubescent children   Sexual Masochism  receiving humiliation or suffering   Sexual Sadism  inflicting humiliation or suffering   Transvestic Fetishism  cross-dressing   and Voyeurism  observing sexual activity   A residual cate- gory  Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified  includes other Paraphilias that are less frequently encountered  Not uncommonly  individuals have more than one Paraphilia Gender Identity Disorders Gender Identity DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThere are two components of Gender Identity Disorder  both of which must be present to make the diagnosis  There must be evidence of a strong and persistent cross-gender identification  which is the desire to be  or the insistence that one is  of the other sex
 Criterion A   This cross-gender identification must not merely be a desire for any perceived cultural advantages of being the other sex  There must also be evidence of persistent discomfort about one's assigned sex or a sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex  Criterion B   The diagnosis is not made if the individual has a concurrent physical intersex condition  e g   androgen insensitivity syndrome or con- genital adrenal hyperplasia   Criterion C   To make the diagnosis  there must be evidence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion D  In boys  the cross-gender identification is manifested by a marked preoccupation with traditionally feminine activities  They may have a preference for dressing in girls' or women's clothes or may improvise such items from available materials when genuine articles are unavailable  Towels  aprons  and scarves are often used to represent long hair or skirts  There is a strong attraction for the stereotypical games and pastimes of girls  They particularly enjoy playing house  drawing pictures of beautiful girls and princesses  and watching television or videos of their favorite female characters  Stereotypical female-type dolls  such as Barbie  are often their favorite toys  and girls are their preferred playmates  When playing "house " these boys role-play female figures  most commonly "mother roles " and often are quite preoccupied with female fantasy figures  They avoid rough-and-tumble play and competitive sports and have little interest in cars and trucks or other nonaggressive but stereotypical boy's toys  They may express a wish to be a girl and assert that they will grow up to be a woman  They may insist on sitting to urinate and pretend not to have a penis by pushing it in between their legs  More rarely  boys with Gender Identity Disorder may state that they find their penis or testes disgusting  that they want to remove them  or that they have  or wish to have  a vagina Girls with Gender Identity Disorder display intense negative reactions to parental expectations or attempts to have them wear dresses or other feminine attire  Some may refuse to attend school or social events where such clothes may be required  They prefer boy's clothing and short hair  are often misidentified by strangers as boys  and may ask to be called by a boy's name  Their fantasy heroes are most often powerful male figures  such as Batman or Superman  These girls prefer boys as playmates  with whom they share interests in contact sports  rough-and-tumble play  and traditional boyhood games  They show little interest in dolls or any form of feminine dress up or role-play activity  A girl with this disorder may occasionally refuse to urinate in a sitting position  She may claim that she has or will grow a penis and may not want to grow breasts or to menstruate  She may assert that she will grow up to be a man  Such girls typically reveal marked cross-gender identification in role-play  dreams  and fantasies Adults with Gender Identity Disorder are preoccupied with their wish to live as a member of the other sex  This preoccupation may be manifested as an intense desire to adopt the social role of the other sex or to acquire the physical appearance of the other sex through hormonal or surgical manipulation  Adults with this disorder are uncomfortable being regarded by others as  or functioning in society as  a member of their designated sex  To varying degrees  they adopt the behavior  dress  and mannerisms of the other sex  In private  these individuals may spend much time cross-dressed and working on the appearance of being the other sex  Many attempt to pass in public as the other sex  With cross-dressing and hormonal treatment  and for males  electrolysis   many individuals with this disorder may pass convincingly as the other sex  The sexual activity of these individuals with same-sex partners is generally constrained by the preference that their partners neither see nor touch their genitals  For some males who present later in life   often following marriage   sexual activity with a woman is accompanied by the fantasy of being lesbian lovers or that his partner is a man and he is a woman In adolescents  the clinical features may resemble either those of children or those of adults  depending on the individual's developmental level  and the criteria should be applied accordingly  In a younger adolescent  it may be more difficult to arrive at an accurate diagnosis because of the adolescent's guardedness  This may be increased if the adolescent feels ambivalent about cross-gender identification or feels that it is unacceptable to the family  The adolescent may be referred because the parents or teachers are concerned about social isolation or peer teasing and rejection  In such circumstances  the diagnosis should be reserved for those adolescents who appear quite cross-gender identified in their dress and who engage in behaviors that suggest significant cross-gender identification  e g   shaving legs in males   Clarifying the diagnosis in children and adolescents may require monitoring over an extended period of time Distress or disability in individuals with Gender Identity Disorder is manifested differently across the life cycle  In young children  distress is manifested by the stated unhappiness about their assigned sex  Preoccupation with cross-gender wishes often interferes with ordinary activities  In older children  failure to develop age-appropriate same-sex peer relationships and skills often leads to isolation and distress  and some children may refuse to attend school because of teasing or pressure to dress in attire stereotypical of their assigned sex  In adolescents and adults  preoccupation with cross-gender wishes often interferes with ordinary activities  Relationship difficulties are common and functioning at school or at work may be impaired 307 1 Anorexia NervosaDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of Anorexia Nervosa are that the individual refuses to maintain a minimally normal body weight  is intensely afraid of gaining weight  and exhibits a significant disturbance in the perception of the shape or size of his or her body  In addition  postmenarcheal females with this disorder are amenorrheic   The term anorexia is a misnomer because loss of appetite is rare  The individual maintains a body weight that is below a minimally normal level for age and height  Criterion A   When Anorexia Nervosa develops in an individual during childhood or early adolescence  there may be failure to make expected weight gains  i e   while growing in height  instead of weight loss  Criterion A provides a guideline for determining when the individual meets the threshold for being underweight  It suggests that the individual weigh less than 85%of that weight that is considered normal for that person's age and height  usually computed using one of several published versions of the Metropolitan Life Insurance tables or pediatric growth charts   An alternative and somewhat stricter guideline  used in the ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Research  requires that the individual have a body mass index  BMI   calculated as weight in kilograms/height in meters2  equal to or below 17 5 kg/m2  These cutoffs are provided only as suggested guidelines for the clinician  since it is unreasonable to specify a single standard for minimally normal weight that applies to all individuals of a given age and height  In determining a minimally normal weight  the clinician should consider not only such guidelines but also the individual's body build and weight history Usually weight loss is accomplished primarily through reduction in total food intake  Although individuals may begin by excluding from their diet what they perceive to be highly caloric foods  most eventually end up with a very restricted diet that is sometimes limited to only a few foods  Additional methods of weight loss include purging  i e   self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives or diuretics  and increased or excessive exercise Individuals with this disorder intensely fear gaining weight or becoming fat  Criterion B   This intense fear of becoming fat is usually not alleviated by the weight loss  In fact  concern about weight gain often increases even as actual weight continues to decrease The experience and significance of body weight and shape are distorted in these individuals  Criterion C   Some individuals feel globally overweight  Others realize that they are thin  but are still concerned that certain parts of their bodies  particularly the abdomen  buttocks  and thighs  are "too fat " They may employ a wide variety of techniques to estimate their body size or weight  including excessive weighing  obsessive measuring of body parts  and persistently using a mirror to check for perceived areas of "fat " The self-esteem of individuals with Anorexia Nervosa is highly dependent on their body shape and weight  Weight loss is viewed as an impressive achievement and a sign of extraordinary self-discipline  whereas weight gain is perceived as an unacceptable failure of self-control  Though some individuals with this disorder may acknowledge being thin  they typically deny the serious medical implications of their malnourished state In postmenarcheal females  amenorrhea  due to abnormally low levels of estrogen secretion that are due in turn to diminished pituitary secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]  is an indicator of physiological dysfunction in Anorexia Nervosa  Criterion D   Amenorrhea is usually a consequence of the weight loss but  in a minority of individuals  may actually precede it  In prepubertal females  menarche may be delayed by the illness The individual is often brought to professional attention by family members after marked weight loss  or failure to make expected weight gains  has occurred  If individuals seek help on their own  it is usually because of their subjective distress over the somatic and psychological sequelae of starvation  It is rare for an individual with Anorexia Nervosa to complain of weight loss per se  Individuals with Anorexia Nervosa frequently lack insight into  or have considerable denial of  the problem and may be unreliable historians  It is therefore often necessary to obtain information from parents or other outside sources to evaluate the degree of weight loss and other features of the illness 
307 51 Bulimia NervosaDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of Bulimia Nervosa are binge eating and inappropriate compen- satory methods to prevent weight gain  In addition  the self-evaluation of individuals with Bulimia Nervosa is excessively influenced by body shape and weight  To qualify for the diagnosis  the binge eating and the inappropriate compensatory behaviors must occur  on average  at least twice a week for 3 months  CriterionC  A binge is defined as eating in a discrete period of time an amount of food that is definitely larger than most individuals would eat under similar circumstances  Criterion Al   The clinician should consider the context in which the eating occurredâ€”what would be regarded as excessive consumption at a typical meal might be considered normal during a celebration or holiday meal  A "discrete period of time" refers to a limited period  usually less than 2 hours  A single episode of binge eating need not be restricted to one setting  For example  an individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and then continue it on returning home  Continual snacking on small amounts of food throughout the day would not be considered a binge Although the type of food consumed during binges varies  it typically includes sweet  high-calorie foods such as ice cream or cake  However  binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the amount of food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient  such as carbohydrate  Although individuals with BulimiaNervosa consume more calories during an episode of binge eating than persons without Bulimia Nervosa consume during a meal  the fractions of calories derived from protein  fat  and carbohydrate are similar 
Individuals with Bulimia Nervosa are typically ashamed of their eating problems and attempt to conceal their symptoms  Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy  or as inconspicuously as possible  An episode may or may not be planned in advance and is usually  but not always  characterized by rapid consumption  The binge eating often continues until the individual is uncomfortably  or even painfully  full  Binge eating is typically triggered by dysphoric mood states  interpersonal stressors  intense hunger following dietary restraint  or feelings related to body weight  body shape  and food  Binge eating may transiently reduce dysphoria  but disparaging self-criticism and depressed mood often follow An episode of binge eating is also accompanied by a sense of lack of control  Criterion A2   An individual may be in a frenzied state while binge eating  especially early in the course of the disorder  Some individuals describe a dissociative quality during  or following  the binge episodes  After Bulimia Nervosa has persisted for some time  individuals may report that their binge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control  but rather by behavioral indicators of impaired control  such as difficulty resisting binge eating or difficulty stopping a binge once it has begun  The impairment in control associated with binge eating in Bulimia Nervosa is not absolute  for example  an individual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing  but will cease if a roommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room Another essential feature of Bulimia Nervosa is the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain  Criterion B   Many individuals with Bulimia Nervosa employ several methods in their attempt to compensate for binge eating  The most common compensatory technique is the induction of vomiting after an episode of binge eating  This method of purging is employed by 80%-90% of individuals with Bulimia Nervosa who present for treatment at eating disorders clinics  The immediate effects of vomiting include relief from physical discomfort and reduction of fear of gaining weight  In some cases  vomiting becomes a goal in itself  and the person will binge in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of food  Individuals with Bulimia Nervosa may use a variety of methods to induce vomiting  including the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the gag reflex  Individuals generally become adept at inducing vomiting and are eventually able to vomit at will  Rarely  individuals consume syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting  Other purging behaviors include the misuse of laxatives and diuretics  Approximately one-third of those with Bulimia Nervosa misuse laxatives after binge eating  Rarely  individuals with the disorder will misuse enemas following episodes of binge eating  but this is seldom the sole compensatory method employed Individuals with Bulimia Nervosa may fast for a day or more or exercise excessively in an attempt to compensate for binge eating  Exercise may be considered to be excessive when it significantly interferes with important activities  when it occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings  or when the individual continues to exercise despite injury or other medical complications  Rarely  individuals with this disorder may take thyroid hormone in an attempt to avoid weight gain  Individuals with diabetes mellitus and Bulimia Nervosa may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to reduce the metabolism of food consumed during eating binges Individuals with Bulimia Nervosa place an excessive emphasis on body shape and weight in their self-evaluation  and these factors are typically the most important ones in determining self-esteem  Criterion D   Individuals with this disorder may closely resemble those with Anorexia Nervosa in their fear of gaining weight  in their desire to lose weight  and in the level of dissatisfaction with their bodies  However  a diagnosis
of Bulimia Nervosa should not be given when the disturbance occurs only during episodes of Anorexia Nervosa  Criterion E  307 42 Primary InsomniaDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Primary Insomnia is a complaint of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or of nonrestorative sleep that lasts for at least 1 month  Criterion A  and causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion B   The disturbance in sleep does not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep disorder  Criterion C  or mental disorder  Criterion D  and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition  CriterionE  Individuals with Primary Insomnia most often report a combination of difficulty falling asleep and intermittent wakefulness during sleep  Less commonly  these individuals may complain only of nonrestorative sleep  that is  feeling that their sleep was restless  light  or of poor quality  Primary Insomnia is often associated with increased physiological or psychological arousal at nighttime in combination with negative conditioning for sleep  A marked preoccupation with and distress due to the inability to sleep may contribute to the development of a vicious cycle  the more the individual strives to sleep  the more frustrated and distressed the individual becomes and the less he or she is able to sleep  Lying in a bed in which the individual has frequently spent sleepless nights may cause frustration and conditioned arousal  Conversely  the individual may fall asleep more easily when not trying to do so  e g   while watching television  reading  or riding in a car   Some individuals with increased arousal and negative conditioning report that they sleep better away from their own bedrooms and their usual routines  Chronic insomnia may lead to decreased feelings of well-being during the day  e g   deterioration of mood and motivation  decreased attention  energy  and concentration  and an increase in fatigue and malaise   Although individuals often have the subjective complaint of daytime fatigue  polysomnographic studies usually do not demonstrate an increase in physiological signs of sleepiness 307 44 Primary HypersomniaDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Primary Hypersomnia is excessive sleepiness for at least 1 month as evidenced either by prolonged sleep episodes or by daytime sleep episodes occurring almost daily  Criterion A   The excessive sleepiness must be sufficiently severe to cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion B   The excessive sleepiness does not occur exclusively during the course of another Sleep Disorder  Criterion C  or mental disorder  Criterion D  and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition  Criterion E   In individuals with Primary Hypersomnia  the duration of the major sleep episode  for most individuals  nocturnal sleep  may range from 8 to 12 hours and is often followed by difficulty awakening in the morning  The actual quality of nocturnal sleep is normal  Excessive sleepiness during normal waking hours takes the form of intentional naps or inadvertent episodes of sleep  Objective measurements demonstrate increased physiological sleepiness  Daytime naps tend to be relatively long  often lasting an hour or more   are experienced as unrefreshing  and often do not lead to improved alertness  Individuals typically feel sleepiness developing over a period of time  rather than experiencing a sudden sleep "attack " Unintentional sleep episodes typically occur in low-stimulation and low-activity situations  e g   while attending lectures  reading  watching television  or driving long distances  Hypersomnia can lead to significant distress and dysfunction in work and social relationships  Prolonged nocturnal sleep and difficulty awakening can result in difficulty in meeting morning obligations  Unintentional daytime sleep episodes can be embarrassing and even dangerous  if  for instance  the individual is driving or operating machinery when the episode occurs  The low level of alertness that occurs while an individual fights sleepiness can lead to poor efficiency  poor concentration  and poor memory during daytime activities  Sleepiness  often misattributed to boredom or laziness  can also disrupt social and family relationships 347 NarcolepsyDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of Narcolepsy are repeated irresistible attacks of refreshing sleep  cataplexy  and recurrent intrusions of elements of rapid eye movement  REM  sleep into the transition period between sleep and wakefulness  The individual's sleepiness typically decreases after a sleep attack  only to return several hours later  The sleep attacks must occur daily over a period of at least 3 months to establish the diagnosis  Criterion A   although most individuals describe many years of sleep attacks prior to seeking clinical attention  In addition to sleepiness  individuals with Narcolepsy experience one or both of the following  cataplexy  i e   episodes of sudden  bilateral  reversible loss of muscle tone that last for seconds to minutes and are usually precipitated by intense emotion   Criterion Bl  or recurrent intrusions of elements of rapid eye movement  REM  sleep into the transition between sleep and wakefulness as manifested by paralysis of voluntary muscles or dreamlike hallucinations  Criterion B2   Many sleep experts allow the diagnosis to be made in the absence of cataplexy or intrusions ofREM sleep elements if the individual demonstrates pathological sleepiness and two or more sleep-onset REMperiods during a Multiple Sleep Latency Test  MSLT   The symptoms must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  including a medication  or another general medical condition  Criterion C   Although Narcolepsy is classified in the chapter of ICD devoted to neurological conditions  it is included in this section to assist in differential diagnosis in individuals with excessive sleepiness and is coded on Axis I Episodes of sleepiness in Narcolepsy are often described as irresistible  resulting in unintended sleep in inappropriate situations  e g   while driving an automobile  attending meetings  or carrying on a conversation   Low-stimulation  low-activity situations typically exaggerate the degree of sleepiness  e g   falling asleep while reading  watching television  or attending lectures   Sleep episodes generally last 10-20 minutes but can last up to an hour if uninterrupted  Dreaming is frequently reported  Individuals have varying abilities to "fight off" these sleep attacks  Some individuals take naps intentionally in order to manage their sleepiness  Individuals with Narcolepsy typically have 2-6 episodes of sleep  intentional and unintentional  per day when untreated  Sleep episodes are usually superimposed on a more normal degree of alertness  although some individuals describe constant sleepiness of some degree Cataplexy often develops several years after the onset of daytime sleepiness and occurs in approximately 70% of individuals with the disorder  The loss of muscle tone with cataplexy may be subtle  leading to a sagging jaw or drooping eyelids  head  or arms not noticeable to observers  Cataplexy can also be more dramatic  and the individual may drop objects being carried  buckle at the knees  or actually fall to the ground  Respiratory and eye muscles are not affected  The muscle weakness usually lasts only seconds  although periods of up to a half hour have been reported  Episodes are followed by a full return of normal muscle strength  Full consciousness and alertness are preserved during cataplectic episodes  Individuals can clearly describe events and have no confusion before or after the episode  Rarely  prolonged episodes of cataplexy may lead into sleep episodes  Cataplexy is usually triggered by a strong emotional stimulus  e g   anger  surprise  laughter   Sleep deprivation typically increases the frequency and severity of episodes of cataplexy Approximately 20%-40% of individuals with Narcolepsy also experience intense dreamlike imagery just before falling asleep  hypnagogic hallucinations  or just after awakening  hypnopompic hallucinations   Most sleep-related hallucinations are visual and incorporate elements of the actual environment  For instance  individuals may describe objects appearing through cracks in the wall or describe objects moving in a picture on the wall  The hallucinations may also be auditory  e g   hearing intruders in the home  or kinetic  e g   sensation of flying   Approximately 30%-50% of individuals with Narcolepsy also experience sleep paralysis just on falling asleep or awakening  In this condition  individuals describe being awake but unable to move or speak  They may also complain of feeling unable to breathe  although the diaphragm is spared and respiration continues  Sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis may occur simul-taneously  resulting in an often terrifying experience of seeing or hearing unusual things and being unable to move  Both sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis last for seconds to a few minutes and terminate spontaneously  Both phenomena  vivid mental imagery and skeletal muscle atonia  are thought to result from dissociated elements of REM sleep intruding into wakefulness 780 59 Breathing-Related Sleep DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder is sleep disruption  leading to excessive sleepiness or insomnia that is judged to be due to abnormalities of ventilation during sleep  e g   sleep apnea or central alveolar hypoventilation   Criterion A   This sleep disruption must not be better accounted for by a mental disorder and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  including medication  or a general medical condition that produces sleep symptoms through a mechanism other than abnormal breathing  CriterionB  Excessive sleepiness is the most common presenting complaint of individuals with Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder  Sleepiness results from frequent arousals during nocturnal sleep as the individual attempts to breathe normally  The sleepiness is most evident in relaxing situations  such as when the individual is reading or watching television  The individual's inability to control the sleepiness can be evident in boring meetings or while attending movies  theater  or concerts  When sleepiness is extreme  the person may fall asleep while actively conversing  eating  walking  or driving  Naps tend to be unrefreshing and may be accompanied by a dull headache on awakening  However  there can be considerable variation in the intensity of the sleepiness  The impact of the sleepiness may be minimized by the individual  who may express pride about being able to sleep anywhere at anytime  Insomnia  frequent awakenings  or unrefreshing sleep are less frequent than daytime sleepiness as the presenting complaint in individuals with Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder  Some individuals may complain of difficulty breathing while lying supine or sleeping Abnormal respiratory events during sleep in Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder include apneas  episodes of breathing cessation   hypopneas  abnormally slow or shallow respiration   and hypoventilation  abnormal blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels   Three forms of Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder have been described  obstructive sleep apnea syndrome  central sleep apnea syndrome  and central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is the most common form of Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder  It is characterized by repeated episodes of upper-airway obstruction  apneas and hypopneas  during sleep  The central drive for respiration and respiratory movements in the chest and abdomen are preserved  It usually occurs in overweight individuals and leads to a complaint of excessive sleepiness  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by loud snores or brief gasps that alternate with episodes of silence that usually last 20-30 seconds  Snoring is caused by breathing through a partially obstructed airway  Silent periods are caused by obstructive apneas  with the cessation in breathing caused by complete airway obstruction  Typically the loud snoring has been present for many years  often since childhood  but an increase in its severity may lead the individual to seek evaluation  The snoring is commonly loud enough to disturb the sleep of others in close proximity  The cessation of breathing  sometimes lasting as long as 60-90 seconds and associated with cyanosis  may also be of concern to bed partners  The termination of the apneic event can be associated with loud "resuscitative" snores  gasps  moans or mumbling  or whole-body movements  The bed partner may have to move to a separate bed or another room as a result of the affected individual's snoring  gasps  and movements  Most affected individuals are unaware of the loud snoring  breathing difficulty  and frequent arousals  However  some persons  particularly elderly persons  are intensely aware of the sleep disturbance and present with a complaint of frequent awakenings and unrefreshing sleep Central sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by episodic cessation of ventilation during sleep  apneas and hypopneas  without airway obstruction  Thus  in contrast to obstructive apnea events  central apneas are not associated with continued chest wall and abdominal breathing movements and occur more commonly in elderly persons as a result of cardiac or neurological conditions that affect ventilatory regulation  Individuals most often present with complaints of insomnia due to repeated awakenings  which they may or may not associate with breathing difficulties  Individuals with central sleep apnea may have mild snoring  but it is not a prominent complaint The central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome is characterized by an impairment in ventilatory control that results in abnormally low arterial oxygen levels further worsened by sleep  hypoventilation without apneas or hypopneas   The lungs in individuals with this disorder have normal mechanical properties  This form most commonly occurs in very overweight individuals and can be associated with a complaint of either excessive sleepiness or insomnia 
307 45 Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder  formerly Sleep-Wake Schedule Disorder Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder is a persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that results from a mismatch between the individual's endogenous circadian sleep-wake system on the one hand  and exogenous demands regarding the timing and duration of sleep on the other  Criterion A   In contrast to other primary Sleep Disorders  Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder does not result from the mechanisms generating sleep and wakefulness per se  As a result of this circadian mismatch  individuals with this disorder may complain of insomnia at certain times during the day and excessive sleepiness at other times  with resulting impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning or marked subjective distress  Criterion B   The sleep problems are not better accounted for by other Sleep Disorders or other mental disorders  Criterion C  and are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition  Criterion D  The diagnosis of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder should be reserved for those presentations in which the individual has significant social or occupational impairment or marked distress related to the sleep disturbance  Individuals vary widely in their ability to adapt to circadian changes and requirements  Many  if not most  individuals with circadian-related symptoms of sleep disturbance do not seek treatment and do not have symptoms of sufficient severity to warrant a diagnosis  Those who present for evaluation because of this disorder are most often troubled by the severity or persistence of their symptoms  For example  it is not unusual for shift workers to present for evaluation after falling asleep while on the job or while driving The diagnosis of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder rests primarily on the clinical history  including the pattern of work  sleep  naps  and "free time " The history should also examine past attempts at coping with symptoms  such as attempts at advancing the sleep-wake schedule in Delayed Sleep Phase Type  Prospective sleep-wake diaries or sleep charts are often a useful adjunct to diagnosis 
307 47 Nightmare Disorder formerly Dream Anxiety Disorder  Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Nightmare Disorder is the repeated occurrence of frightening dreams that lead to awakenings from sleep  Criterion A   The individual becomes fully alert on awakening  Criterion B   The frightening dreams or sleep interruptions resulting from the awakenings cause the individual significant distress or result in social or occupational dysfunction  Criterion C   This disorder is not diagnosed if the nightmares occur exclusively during the course of another mental disorder or are due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse or a medication  or a general medical condition  Criterion D  Nightmares typically occur in a lengthy  elaborate dream sequence that is highly anxiety provoking or terrifying  Dream content most often focuses on imminent physical danger to the individual  e g   pursuit  attack  injury   In other cases  the perceived danger may be more subtle  involving personal failure or embarrassment  Nightmares that occur after traumatic experiences may replicate the original dangerous or threatening situation  but most nightmares do not recount actual events  On awakening  individuals with this disorder can describe the dream sequence and content in detail  Individuals may report multiple nightmares within a given night  often with a recurrent theme  Nightmares arise almost exclusively during rapid eye movement  REM sleep  Because REM episodes occur periodically throughout nocturnal sleep  approximately every 90-110 minutes   nightmares may also occur at any time during the sleep episode  However  because REM sleep periods typically become longer and dreaming more intense in the second half of the night  nightmares are also more likely to occur later in the night Nightmares usually terminate with an awakening that is associated with a rapid return of full alertness and a lingering sense of fear or anxiety  These factors often lead to difficulty returning to sleep  Nightmare Disorder causes significant subjective distress more often than it causes demonstrable social or occupational impairment  However  if nocturnal awakenings are frequent  or if the individual avoids sleeping because of fear of nightmares  the individual may experience excessive sleepiness  poor concentration  depression  anxiety  or irritability that can disrupt daytime functioning 307 46 Sleep Terror DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Sleep Terror Disorder is the repeated occurrence of sleep terrors  that is  abrupt awakenings from sleep usually beginning with a panicky scream or cry  Criterion A   Sleep terrors usually begin during the first third of the major sleep episode and last 1-10 minutes  The episodes are accompanied by autonomic arousal and behavioral manifestations of intense fear  Criterion B   During an episode  the individual is difficult to awaken or comfort  Criterion C   If the individual awakens after the sleep terror  no dream is recalled  or only fragmentary  single images are recalled  On awakening the following morning  the individual has amnesia for the event  Criterion D   The sleep terror episodes must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion E   Sleep Terror Disorder should not be diagnosed if the recurrent events are due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition  Criterion F   Sleep terrors are also called "night terrors" or pavor nocturnus During a typical episode  the individual abruptly sits up in bed screaming or crying  with a frightened expression and autonomic signs of intense anxiety  e g   tachycardia  rapid breathing  flushing of the skin  sweating  dilation of the pupils  increased muscle tone   The individual is usually unresponsive to the efforts of others to awaken or comfort him or her  If awakened  the person is confused and disoriented for several minutes and recounts a vague sense of terror  usually without dream content  Although fragmentary vivid dream images may occur  a story-like dream sequence  as in nightmares  is not reported  Most commonly  the individual does not awaken fully  but returns to sleep  and has amnesia for the episode on awakening the next morning  Some individuals may vaguely recall having an "episode" during the previous night  but do not have detailed recall  Usually only one episode will occur on any one night  although occasionally several episodes may occur at intervals throughout the night For the diagnosis to be made  the individual must experience clinically significant distress or impairment  Embarrassment concerning the episodes can impair social relationships  Individuals may avoid situations in which others might become aware of the disturbance  such as going to camp  visiting friends overnight  or sleeping with bed partners 307 46 Sleepwalking DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Sleepwalking Disorder is repeated episodes of complex motor behavior initiated during sleep  including rising from bed and walking about  Sleepwalk- ing episodes begin during slow-wave sleep and therefore most often occur during the first third of the night  Criterion A   During episodes  the individual has reduced alertness and responsiveness  a blank stare  and relative unresponsiveness to communication with others or efforts to be awakened by others  Criterion B   If awakened during the episode  or on awakening the following morning   the individual has limited recall for the events of the episode  Criterion C   After the episode  there may initially be a brief period of confusion or difficulty orienting  followed by full recovery of cognitive function and appropriate behavior  Criterion D   The sleepwalking must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  Criterion E   Sleepwalking Disorder should not be diagnosed if the behavior is due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   a drug of abuse  a medication  or a general medical condition  CriterionF  Sleepwalking episodes can include a variety of behaviors  In mild episodes  sometimes called "confusional arousals"   the individual may simply sit up in bed  look about  or pick at the blanket or sheet  More typically  the individual actually gets out of bed and may walk into closets  out of the room  up and down stairs  and even out of buildings  Individuals may use the bathroom  eat  and talk during episodes  Running and frantic attempts to escape some apparent threat can also occur  Most behaviors during sleepwalking episodes are routine and of low complexity  However  cases of unlocking doors and even operating machinery have been reported  Particularly in childhood  sleepwalking can also include inappropriate behavior  e g   urinating in a closet   Most episodes last for several minutes to a half hour Sleepwalking episodes can terminate in spontaneous arousals followed by a brief period of confusion  or the individual may return to bed and continue to sleep until the morning  Not uncommonly  the individual may awaken the next morning in another place  or with evidence of having performed some activity during the night  but with complete amnesia for the event  Some episodes may be followed by vague recall of fragmentary dream images  but usually not by typical story-like dreams During sleepwalking episodes  individuals may talk or even respond to others' questions  However  their articulation is poor  and true dialogue is rare  Individuals may respond to others' requests to cease their activity and return to bed  However  these behaviors are performed with reduced levels of alertness  and awakening an individual from a sleepwalking episode is typically very difficult  If awakened  the individual remains confused for several minutes and then returns to a normal state of alertness For the diagnosis to be made  the individual must experience clinically significant distress or impairment  Individuals may avoid situations that would reveal their behavior to others  e g   children may avoid visiting friends or going to summer camp  adults may avoid sleeping with bed partners  going on vacation  or staying away from home   Social isolation or occupational difficulties can result Associated Features and DisordersAssociated descriptive features and mental disorders  Internal stimuli  e g   a distended bladder  or external stimuli  e g   noises  can increase the likelihood of a sleepwalking episode  as can psychosocial stressors and alcohol or sedative use  Some individuals with sleepwalking also report episodes of eating during the night  most often with complete or partial amnesia  They may find evidence of their eating only the next morning  Individuals can injure themselves during sleepwalking episodes by bumping into objects  walking on stairs  going outside  and even walking out of windows  The risk of injury further increases if sleepwalking episodes also include features of sleep terrors  with an attendant fleeing or striking out  Individuals with Sleepwalking Disorder and Sleep Terror Disorder can also injure others during episodes Other parasomnias associated with non-rapid eye movement  NREM  sleep  e g   Sleep Terror Disorder  can also occur in individuals with Sleepwalking Disorder  Sleepwalking Disorder in children usually is not associated with other mental disorders  but in adults it may be associated with Personality Disorders  Mood Disorders  or Anxiety Disorders

unhappiness about their lack of relationships  their behavior suggests a decreased desire for intimate contacts  As a result  they usually have no or few close friends or confidants other than a first-degree relative  Criterion A8   They are anxious in social situations  particularly those involving unfamiliar people  Criterion A9   They will interact with other people when they have to  but prefer to keep to themselves because they feel that they are different and just do not "fit in " Their social anxiety does not easily abate  even when they spend more time in the setting or become more familiar with the other people  because their anxiety tends to be associated with suspiciousness regarding others' motivations  For example  when attending a dinner party  the individual with Schizotypal Personality Disorder will not become more relaxed as time goes on  but rather may become increasingly tense and suspicious Schizotypal Personality Disorder should not be diagnosed if the pattern of behavior occurs exclusively during the course of Schizophrenia  a Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features  another Psychotic Disorder  or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder  Criterion B

there are unavoidable changes in plans  e g   sudden despair in reaction to a clinician's announcing the end of the hour  panic or fury when someone important to them is just a few minutes late or must cancel an appointment   They may believe that this "abandonment" implies they are "bad " These abandonment fears are related to an intolerance of being alone and a need to have other people with them  Their frantic efforts to avoid abandonment may include impulsive actions such as self-mutilating or suicidal behaviors  which are described separately in Criterion 5 Individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder have a pattern of unstable and intense relationships  Criterion 2   They may idealize potential caregivers or lovers at the first or second meeting  demand to spend a lot of time together  and share the most intimate details early in a relationship  However  they may switch quickly from idealizing other people to devaluing them  feeling that the other person does not care enough  does not give enough  is not "there" enough  These individuals can empathize with and nurture other people  but only with the expectation that the other person will "be there" in return to meet their own needs on demand  These individuals are prone to sudden and dramatic shifts in their view of others  who may alternately be seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive  Such shifts often reflect disillusionment with a caregiver whose nurturing qualities had been idealized or whose rejection or abandonment is expected There may be an identity disturbance characterized by markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self  Criterion 3   There are sudden and dramatic shifts in self-image  characterized by shifting goals  values  and vocational aspirations  There may be sudden changes in opinions and plans about career  sexual identity  values  and types of friends  These individuals may suddenly change from the role of a needy supplicant for help to a righteous avenger of past mistreatment  Although they usually have a self-image that is based on being bad or evil  individuals with this disorder may at times have feelings that they do not exist at all  Such experiences usually occur in situations in which the individual feels a lack of a meaningful relationship  nurturing  and support  These individuals may show worse performance in unstructured work or school situations Individuals with this disorder display impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging  Criterion 4   They may gamble  spend money irresponsibly  binge eat  abuse substances  engage in unsafe sex  or drive recklessly  Individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder display recurrent suicidal behavior  gestures  or threats  or self-mutilating behavior  Criterion 5   Completed suicide occurs in 8%-10% of such individuals  and self-mutilative acts  e g   cutting or burning  and suicide threats and attempts are very common  Recurrent suicidality is often the reason that these individuals present for help  These self-destructive acts are usually precipitated by threats of separation or rejection or by expectations that they assume increased responsibility  Self-mutilation may occur during dissociative experiences and often brings relief by reaffirming the ability to feel or by expiating the individual's sense of being evil Individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder may display affective instability that is due to a marked reactivity of mood  e g   intense episodic dysphoria  irritability  or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days   Criterion 6   The basic dysphoric mood of those with Borderline Personality Disorder is often disrupted by periods of anger  panic  or despair and is rarely relieved by periods of well-being or satisfaction  These episodes may reflect the individual's extreme reactivity to interpersonal stresses  Individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder may be troubled by chronic feelings of emptiness  Criterion 7   Easily bored  they may constantly seek something to do  Individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder frequently express inappropriate  intense anger or have difficulty controlling their anger  Criterion 8   They may display extreme sarcasm  enduring bitterness  or verbal outbursts  The anger is often elicited when a caregiver or lover is seen as neglectful  withholding  uncaring  or abandoning  Such expressions of anger are often followed by shame and guilt and contribute to the feeling they have of being evil  During periods of extreme stress  transient paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms  e g   depersonalization  may occur  Criterion 9   but these are generally of insufficient severity or duration to warrant an additional diagnosis  These episodes occur most frequently in response to a real or imagined abandonment  Symptoms tend to be transient  lasting minutes or hours  The real or perceived return of the caregiver's nurturance may result in a remission of symptoms

301 6 Dependent Personality DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Dependent Personality Disorder is a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation  This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts  The dependent and submissive behaviors are designed to elicit caregiving and arise from a self-perception of being unable to function adequately without the help of others Individuals with Dependent Personality Disorder have great difficulty making everyday decisions  e g   what color shirt to wear to work or whether to carry an umbrella  without an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others  Criterion 1   These individuals tend to be passive and to allow other people  often a single other person  to take the initiative and assume responsibility for most major areas of their lives  Criterion 2   Adults with this disorder typically depend on a parent or spouse to decide where they should live  what kind of job they should have  and which neighbors to befriend  Adolescents with this disorder may allow their parent s  to decide what they should wear  with whom they should associate  how they should spend their free time  and what school or college they should attend  This need for others to assume responsibility goes beyond age-appropriate and situation-appropriate requests for assistance from others  e g   the specific needs of children  elderly persons  and handicapped persons   Dependent Personality Disorder may occur in an individual who has a serious general medical condition or disability  but in such cases the difficulty in taking responsibility must go beyond what would normally be associated with that condition or disability Because they fear losing support or approval  individuals with Dependent Personality Disorder often have difficulty expressing disagreement with other people  especially those on whom they are dependent  Criterion 3   These individuals feel so unable to function alone that they will agree with things that they feel are wrong rather than risk losing the help of those to whom they look for guidance  They do not get appropriately angry at others whose support and nurturance they need for fear of alienating them  If the individual's concerns regarding the consequences of expressing disagreement are realistic  e g   realistic fears of retribution from an abusive spouse   the behavior should not be considered to be evidence of Dependent PersonalityDisorder Individuals with this disorder have difficulty initiating projects or doing things independently  Criterion 4   They lack self-confidence and believe that they need help to begin and carry through tasks  They will wait for others to start things because they believe that as a rule others can do them better  These individuals are convinced that they are incapable of functioning independently and present themselves as inept and requiring constant assistance  They are  however  likely to function adequately if given the assurance that someone else is supervising and approving  There may be a fear of becoming or appearing to be more competent  because they may believe that this will lead to abandonment  Because they rely on others to handle their problems  they often do not learn the skills of independent living  thus perpetuating dependency Individuals with Dependent Personality Disorder may go to excessive lengths to obtain nurturance and support from others  even to the point of volunteering for unpleasant tasks if such behavior will bring the care they need  Criterion 5   They are willing to submit to what others want  even if the demands are unreasonable  Their need to maintain an important bond will often result in imbalanced or distorted relationships  They may make extraordinary self-sacrifices or tolerate verbal  physical  or sexual abuse   It should be noted that this behavior should be considered evidence of Dependent Personality Disorder only when it can clearly be established that other options are available to the individual   Individuals with this disorder feel uncomfortable or helpless when alone  because of their exaggerated fears of being unable to care for themselves  Criterion 6   They will "tag along" with important others just to avoid being alone  even if they are not interested or involved in what is happening When a close relationship ends  e g   a breakup with a lover  the death of a caregiver   individuals with Dependent Personality Disorder may urgently seek another relationship to provide the care and support they need  Criterion 7   Their belief that they are unable to function in the absence of a close relationship motivates these individuals to become quickly and indiscriminately attached to another person  Individuals with this disorder are often preoccupied with fears of being left to care for themselves  Criterion 8   They see themselves as so totally dependent on the advice and help of an important other person that they worry about being abandoned by that person when there are no grounds to justify such fears  To be considered as evidence of this criterion  the fears must be excessive and unrealistic  For example  an elderly man with cancer who moves into his son's household for care is exhibiting dependent behavior that is appropriate given this person's life circumstances 301 4 Obsessive-Compulsive Personality DisorderDiagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder is a preoccupation with orderliness  perfectionism  and mental and interpersonal control  at the expense of flexibility  openness  and efficiency  This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts Individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder attempt to maintain a sense of control through painstaking attention to rules  trivial details  procedures  lists  schedules  or form to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost  Criterion 1   They are excessively careful and prone to repetition  paying extraordinary attention to detail and repeatedly checking for possible mistakes  They are oblivious to the fact that other people tend to become very annoyed at the delays and inconveniences that result from this behavior  For example  when such individuals misplace a list of things to be done  they will spend an inordinate amount of time looking for the list rather than spending a few moments re-creating it from memory and proceeding to accomplish the tasks  Time is poorly allocated  the most important tasks being left to the last moment  The perfectionism and self-imposed high standards of performance cause significant dysfunction and distress in these individuals They may become so involved in making every detail of a project absolutely perfect that the project is never finished  Criterion 2   For example  the completion of a written report is delayed by numerous time-consuming rewrites that all come up short of "perfection " Deadlines are missed  and aspects of the individual's life that are not the current focus of activity may fall into disarray Individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder display excessive devotion to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships  Criterion 3   This behavior is not accounted for by economic necessity  They often feel that they do not have time to take an evening or a weekend day off to go on an outing or to just relax  They may keep postponing a pleasurable activity  such as a vacation  so that it may never occur  When they do take time for leisure activities or vacations  they are very uncomfortable unless they have taken along something to work on so they do not "waste time " There may be a great concentration on household chores  e g   repeated excessive cleaning so that "one could eat off the floor"   If they spend time with friends  it is likely to be in some kind of formally organized activity  e g   sports   Hobbies or recreational activities are approached as serious tasks requiring careful organization and hard work to master  The emphasis is on perfect performance  These individuals turn play into a structured task  e g   correcting an infant for not putting rings on the post in the right order  telling a toddler to ride his or her tricycle in a straight line  turning a baseball game into a harsh "lesson"  Individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder may be excessively conscientious  scrupulous  and inflexible about matters of morality  ethics  or values  Criterion 4   They may force themselves and others to follow rigid moral principles and very strict standards of performance  They may also be mercilessly self-critical about their own mistakes  Individuals with this disorder are rigidly deferential to authority and rules and insist on quite literal compliance  with no rule bending for extenuating circumstances  For example  the individual will not lend a quarter to a friend who needs one to make a telephone call  because "neither a borrower or lender be" or because it would be "bad" for the person's character  These qualities should not be accounted for by the individual's cultural or religious identification Individuals with this disorder may be unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects  even when they have no sentimental value  Criterion 5   Often these individuals will admit to being "pack rats " They regard discarding objects as wasteful because "you never know when you might need something" and will become upset if someone tries to get rid of the things they have saved  Their spouses or roommates may complain about the amount of space taken up by old parts  magazines  broken appliances  and so on Individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder are reluctant to dele- gate tasks or to work with others  Criterion 6   They stubbornly and unreasonably insist that everything be done their way and that people conform to their way of doing things  They often give very detailed instructions about how things should be done  e g   there is one and only one way to mow the lawn  wash the dishes  build a doghouse  and are surprised and irritated if others suggest creative alternatives  At other times they may reject offers of help even when behind schedule because they believe no one else can do it right Individuals with this disorder may be miserly and stingy and maintain a standard of living far below what they can afford  believing that spending must be tightly controlled to provide for future catastrophes  Criterion 7   Individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder are characterized by rigidity and stubbornness  Criterion 8   They are so concerned about having things done the one "correct" way that they have trouble going along with anyone else's ideas  These individuals plan ahead in meticulous detail and are unwilling to consider changes  Totally wrapped up in their own perspective  they have difficulty acknowledging the viewpoints of others  Friends and colleagues may become frustrated by this constant rigidity  Even when individuals with Obsessive- Compulsive Personality Disorder recognize that it may be in their interest to compromise  they may stubbornly refuse to do so  arguing that it is "the principle of the thing "Associated Features and DisordersWhen rules and established procedures do not dictate the correct answer  decision making may become a time-consuming  often painful process  Individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder may have such difficulty deciding which tasks take priority or what is the best way of doing some particular task that they may never get started on anything  They are prone to become upset or angry in situations in which they are not able to maintain control of their physical or interpersonal environment  although the anger is typically not expressed directly  For example  a person may be angry when service in a restaurant is poor  but instead of complaining to the management  the individual ruminates about how much to leave as a tip  On other occasions  anger may be expressed with righteous indignation over a seemingly minor matter  People with this disorder may be especially attentive to their relative status in dominance-submission relationships and may display excessive deference to an authority they respect and excessive resistance to authority that they do not respect Individuals with this disorder usually express affection in a highly controlled or stilted fashion and may be very uncomfortable in the presence of others who are emotionally expressive  Their everyday relationships have a formal and serious quality  and they may be stiff in situations in which others would smile and be happy  e g   greeting a lover at the airport   They carefully hold themselves back until they are sure that whatever they say will be perfect  They may be preoccupied with logic and intellect  and intolerant of affective behavior in others  They often have difficulty expressing tender feelings  rarely paying compliments  Individuals with this disorder may experience occupational difficulties and distress  particularly when confronted with new situations that demand flexibility and compromise Although some studies suggest an association with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  included in the "Anxiety Disorders" section  p  417   it appears that the majority of individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder do not have a pattern of behavior that meets criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder  Many of the features of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder overlap with "type A" personality characteristics  e g   hostility  competitiveness  and time urgency   and these features may be present in people at risk for myocardial infarction  There may be an association between Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder and Mood and Anxiety Disorders Specific Culture and Gender FeaturesIn assessing an individual for Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder  the clinician should not include those behaviors that reflect habits  customs  or interpersonal styles that are culturally sanctioned by the individual's reference group  Certain cultures place substantial emphasis on work and productivity  the resulting behaviors in members of those societies need not be considered indications of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder  In systematic studies  the disorder appears to be diagnosed about twice as often among males
