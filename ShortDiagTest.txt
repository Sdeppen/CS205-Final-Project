mental retardation

the essential feature of mental retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning criterion a that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas communication self-care home living social/interpersonal skills use of community resources self-direction functional academic skills work leisure health and safety criterion b the onset must occur before age 18 years criterion c mental retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the central nervous system
general intellectual functioning is defined by the intelligence quotient iq or iq-equivalent obtained by assessment with one or more of the standardized individually administered intelligence tests wechsler intelligence scales for childrenâ€” revised stanford-binet kaufman assessment battery for children significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is defined as an iq of about 70 or below approximately 2 standard deviations below the mean it should be noted that there is a measurement error of approximately 5 points in assessing iq although this may vary from instrument to instrument a wechsler iq of 70 is considered to represent a range of 65-75 thus it is possible to diagnose mental retardation in individuals with iqs between 70 and 75 who exhibit significant deficits in adaptive behavior conversely mental retardation would not be diagnosed in an individual with an iq lower than 70 if there are no significant deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning the choice of testing instruments and interpretation of results should take into account factors that may limit test performance the individual's sociocultural background native language and associated communicative motor and sensory handicaps when there is significant scatter in the subtest scores the profile of strengths and weaknesses rather than the mathematically derived full-scale iq will more accurately reflect the person's learning abilities when there is a marked discrepancy across verbal and performance scores averaging to obtain a full-scale iq score can be misleading
impairments in adaptive functioning rather than a low iq are usually the presenting symptoms in individuals with mental retardation adaptive functioning refers to how effectively individuals cope with common life demands and how well they meet the standards of personal independence expected of someone in their particular age group sociocultural background and community setting adaptive functioning may be influenced by various factors including education motivation personality characteristics social and vocational opportunities and the mental disorders and general medical conditions that may coexist with mental retardation problems in adaptation are more likely to improve with remedial efforts than is the cognitive iq which tends to remain a more stable attribute
it is useful to gather evidence for deficits in adaptive functioning from one or more reliable independent sources teacher evaluation and educational developmental and medical history several scales have also been designed to measure adaptive functioning or behavior the vineland adaptive behavior scales and the american association on mental retardation adaptive behavior scale these scales generally provide a clinical cutoff score that is a composite of performance in a number of adaptive skill domains it should be noted that scores for certain individual domains are not included in some of these instruments and that individual domain scores may vary considerably in reliability as in the assessment of intellectual functioning consideration should be given to the suitability of the instrument to the person's sociocultural background education associated handicaps motivation and cooperation for instance the presence of significant handicaps invalidates many adaptive scale norms in addition behaviors that would normally be considered maladaptive dependency passivity may be evidence of good adaptation in the context of a particular individual's life in some institutional settings

31500 reading disorder

the essential feature of reading disorder is reading achievement ie reading accuracy speed or comprehension as measured by individually administered standardized tests that falls substantially below that expected given the individual's chronological age measured intelligence and age-appropriate education criterion a the disturbance in reading significantly interferes with academic achievement or with activities of daily living that require reading skills criterion b if a sensory deficit is present the reading difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with it criterion c if a neurological or other general medical condition or sensory deficit is present it should be coded on axis iii in individuals with reading disorder which has also been called dyslexia oral reading is characterized by distortions substitutions or omissions both oral and silent reading are characterized by slowness and errors in comprehension

3151 mathematics disorder

the essential feature of mathematics disorder is mathematical ability as measured by individually administered standardized tests of mathematical calculation or reasoning that falls substantially below that expected for the individual's chronological age measured intelligence and age-appropriate education criterion a the disturbance in mathematics significantly interferes with academic achievement or with activities of daily living that require mathematical skills criterion b if a sensory deficit is present the difficulties in mathematical ability are in excess of those usually associated with it criterion c if a neurological or other general medical condition or sensory deficit is present it should be coded on axis iii a number of different skills may be impaired in mathematics disorder including linguistic skillsunderstanding or naming mathematical terms operations or concepts and decoding written problems into mathematical symbols perceptual skillsrecognizing or reading numerical symbols or arithmetic signs and clustering objects into groups attention skillscopying numbers or figures correctly remembering to add in carried numbers and observing operational signs and mathematical skillsfollowing sequences of mathematical steps counting objects and learning multiplication tables

3152 disorder of written expression

the essential feature of disorder of written expression is writing skills as measured by an individually administered standardized test or functional assessment of writing skills that fall substantially below those expected given the individual's chronological age measured intelligence and age-appropriate education criterion a the disturbance in written expression significantly interferes with academic achievement or with activities of daily living that require writing skills criterion b if a sensory deficit is present the difficulties in writing skills are in excess of those usually associated with it criterion c if a neurological or other general medical condition or sensory deficit is present it should be coded on axis iii there is generally a combination of difficulties in the individual's ability to compose written texts evidenced by grammatical or punctuation errors within sentences poor paragraph organization multiple spelling errors and excessively poor handwriting this diagnosis is generally not given if there are only spelling errors or poor handwriting in the absence of other impairment in written expression compared with other learning disorders relatively less is known about disorders of written expression and their remediation particularly when they occur in the absence of reading disorder except for spelling standardized tests in this area are less well developed than tests of reading or mathematical ability and the evaluation of impairment in written skills may require a comparison between extensive samples of the individual's written schoolwork and expected performance for age and iq this is especially the case for young children in the early elementary grades tasks in which the child is asked to copy write to dictation and write spontaneously may all be necessary to establish the presence and extent of this disorder

3159 learning disorder not otherwise specified
this category is for disorders in learning that do not meet criteria for any specific learning disorder this category might include problems in all three areas reading mathematics written expression that together significantly interfere with academic achievement even though performance on tests measuring each individual skill is not substantially below that expected given the person's chronological age measured intelligence and age- appropriate education

3154 developmental coordination disorder

the essential feature of developmental coordination disorder is a marked impairment in the development of motor coordination criterion a the diagnosis is made only if this impairment significantly interferes with academic achievement or activities of daily living criterion b the diagnosis is made if the coordination difficulties are not due to a general medical conditioncerebral palsy hemiplegia or muscular dystrophy and the criteria are not met for pervasive developmental disorder criterion c if mental retardation is present the motor difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with it criterion d the manifestations of this disorder vary with age and development for example younger children may display clumsiness and delays in achieving developmental motor milestoneswalking crawling sitting tying shoelaces

31531 expressive language disorder

the essential feature of expressive language disorder is an impairment in expressive language development as demonstrated by scores on standardized individually administered measures of expressive language development substantially below those obtained from standardized measures of both nonverbal intellectual capacity and receptive language development criterion a the difficulties may occur in communication involving both verbal language and sign language the language difficulties interfere with academic or occupational achievement or with social communication criterion b the symptoms do not meet criteria for mixed receptive-expressive language disorder or a pervasive developmental disorder criterion c if mental retardation a speech- motor or sensory deficit or environmental deprivation is present the language difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with these problems criterion d if a speech-motor or sensory deficit or neurological condition is present it should be coded on axisiii
the linguistic features of the disorder vary depending on its severity and the age of the child these features include a limited amount of speech limited range of vocabulary difficulty acquiring new wordsword-finding or vocabulary errors shortened sentences simplified grammatical structures limited varieties of grammatical structures verb forms limited varieties of sentence types imperatives questions omissions of critical parts of sentences use of unusual word order and slow rate of language development nonlinguistic functioning as measured by performance intelligence tests and language comprehension skills are usually within normal limits expressive language disorder may be either acquired or developmental in the acquired type an impairment in expressive language occurs after a period of normal development as a result of a neurological or other general medical condition encephalitis head trauma irradiation in the developmental type there is an impairment in expressive language that is not associated with a neurological insult of known origin children with this type often begin speaking late and progress more slowly than usual through the various stages of expressive language development

31531 mixed receptive-expressive language disorder

the essential feature of mixed receptive-expressive language disorder is an impairment in both receptive and expressive language development as demonstrated by scores on standardized individually administered measures of both receptive and expressive language development that are substantially below those obtained from standardized measures of nonverbal intellectual capacity criterion a the difficulties may occur in communication involving both verbal language and sign language the language difficulties interfere with academic or occupational achievement or with social communication criterion b and the symptoms do not meet criteria for a pervasive develop- mental disorder criterion c if mental retardation a speech-motor or sensory deficit or environmental deprivation is present the language difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with these problems criterion d if a speech-motor or sensory deficit or neurological condition is present it should be coded on axisiii
an individual with this disorder has the difficulties associated with expressive language disordera markedly limited vocabulary errors in tense difficulty recalling words or producing sentences with developmentally appropriate length or complexity and general difficulty expressing ideas and also has impairment in receptive language developmentdifficulty understanding words sentences or specific types of words in mild cases there may be difficulties only in understanding particular types of wordsspatial terms or statementscomplex if-then sentences in more severe cases there may be multiple disabilities including an inability to understand basic vocabulary or simple sentences and deficits in various areas of auditory processingdiscrimination of sounds association of sounds and symbols storage recall and sequencing because the development of expressive language in childhood relies on the acquisition of receptive skills a pure receptive language disorder analogous to a wernicke's aphasia in adults is virtually never seen
mixed receptive-expressive language disorder may be either acquired or develop- mental in the acquired type an impairment in receptive and expressive language occurs after a period of normal development as a result of a neurological or other general medical conditionencephalitis head trauma irradiation in the developmental type there is an impairment in receptive and expressive language that is not associated with a neurological insult of known origin this type is characterized by a slow rate of language development in which speech may begin late and advance slowly through the stages of language development

these individuals also tend not to engage in the simple imitation games or routines of infancy or early childhood or do so only out of context or in a mechanical way
individuals with autistic disorder have restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior interests and activities there may be an encompassing pre- occupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus criterion a3a an apparently inflexible adherence to specific nonfunctional routines or rituals criterion a3b stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms criterion a3c or a persistent preoccupation with parts of objects criterion a3d individuals with autistic disorder display a markedly restricted range of interests and are often preoccupied with one narrow interestwith amassing facts about meteorology or baseball statistics they may line up an exact number of play things in the same manner over and over again or repetitively mimic the actions of a television actor they may insist on sameness and show resistance to or distress over trivial changesa younger child may have a catastrophic reaction to a minor change in the environment such as a new set of curtains or a change in place at the dinner table there is often an interest in nonfunctional routines or rituals or an unreasonable insistence on following routinestaking exactly the same route to school every daystereotyped body movements include the hands clapping finger flicking or whole body rocking dipping and swaying abnormalities of posturewalking on tiptoe odd hand movements and body postures may be present these individuals show a persistent preoccupation with parts of objects buttons parts of the body there may also be a fascination with movementthe spinning wheels of toys the opening and closing of doors an electric fan or other rapidly revolving object the person may be highly attached to some inanimate objecta piece of string or a rubber band
the disturbance must be manifest by delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas prior to age 3 years social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or imaginative play criterion b there is typically no period of unequivocally normal development although 1 or 2 years of relatively normal development has been reported in some instances in a minority of cases parents report regression in language development generally manifest as the cessation of speech after a child has acquired from 5 to 10 words by definition if there is a period of normal development it cannot extend past age 3 years the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett's disorder or childhood disintegrative disorder criterion c

29980 rett's disorder

attention-deficit and disruptive behavior disorders attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder

the essential feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequent and severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development criterion a some hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms that cause impairment must have been present before age 7 years although many individuals are diagnosed after the symptoms have been present for a number of years criterion b some impairment from the symptoms must be present in at least two settingsat home and at school or work criterion c there must be clear evidence of interference with developmentally appropriate social academic or occupational functioning criterion d the disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a pervasive developmental disorder schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder and is not better accounted for by another mental disordera mood disorder anxiety disorder dissociative disorder or personality disorder criterione
inattention may be manifest in academic occupational or social situations individuals with this disorder may fail to give close attention to details or may make careless mistakes in schoolwork or other tasks criterion ala work is often messy and performed carelessly and without considered thought individuals often have difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities and find it hard to persist with tasks until completion criterion alb they often appear as if their mind is elsewhere or as if they are not listening or did not hear what has just been said criterion ale there may be frequent shifts from one uncompleted activity to another individuals diagnosed with this disorder may begin a task move on to another then turn to yet something else prior to completing any one task they often do not follow through on requests or instructions and fail to complete schoolwork chores or other duties criterion aid failure to complete tasks should be considered in making this diagnosis only if it is due to inattention as opposed to other possible reasonsa failure to understand instructions these individuals often have difficulties organizing tasks and activities criterion ale tasks that require sustained mental effort are experienced as unpleasant and markedly aversive as a result these individuals typically avoid or have a strong dislike for activities that demand sustained self-application and mental effort or that require organizational demands or close concentrationhomework or paperwork criterion aid this avoidance must be due to the person's difficulties with attention and not due to a primary oppositional attitude although secondary oppositionalism may also occur work habits are often disorganized and the materials necessary for doing
the task are often scattered lost or carelessly handled and damaged criterion alg individuals with this disorder are easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli and frequently interrupt ongoing tasks to attend to trivial noises or events that are usually and easily ignored by othersa car honking a background conversation criterion alh they are often forgetful in daily activitiesmissing appointments forgetting to bring lunch criterion ali in social situations inattention may be expressed as frequent shifts in conversation not listening to others not keeping one's mind on conversations and not following details or rules of games or activities
hyperactivity may be manifested by fidgetiness or squirming in one's seat criterion a2a by not remaining seated when expected to do so criterion a2b by excessive running or climbing in situations where it is inappropriate criterion a2c by having difficulty playing or engaging quietly in leisure activities criterion a2d by appearing to be often on the go or as if driven by a motor criterion a2e or by talking excessively criterion a2f hyperactivity may vary with the individual's age and developmental level and the diagnosis should be made cautiously in young children toddlers and preschoolers with this disorder differ from normally active young children by being constantly on the go and into everything they dart back and forth are out of the door before their coat is on jump or climb on furniture run through the house and have difficulty participating in sedentary group activities in preschool classeslistening to a story school-age children display similar behaviors but usually with less frequency or intensity than toddlers and preschoolers they have difficulty remaining seated get up frequently and squirm in or hang on to the edge of their seat they fidget with objects tap their hands and shake their feet or legs excessively they often get up from the table during meals while watching television or while doing homework they talk excessively and they make excessive noise during quiet activities in adolescents and adults symptoms of hyperactivity take the form of feelings of restless- ness and difficulty engaging in quiet sedentary activities
impulsivity manifests itself as impatience difficulty in delaying responses blurting out answers before questions have been completed criterion a2g difficulty awaiting one's turn criterion a2h and frequently interrupting or intruding on others to the point of causing difficulties in social academic or occupational settings criterion a2i others may complain that they cannot get a word in edgewise individuals with this disorder typically make comments out of turn fail to listen to directions initiate conversations at inappropriate times interrupt others excessively intrude on others grab objects from others touch things they are not supposed to touch and clown around impulsivity may lead to accidentsknocking over objects banging into people grabbing a hot pan and to engagement in potentially dangerous activities without consideration of possible consequencesriding a skateboard over extremely rough terrain
behavioral manifestations usually appear in multiple contexts including home school work and social situations to make the diagnosis some impairment must be present in at least two settings criterion c it is very unusual for an individual to display the same level of dysfunction in all settings or within the same setting at all times symptoms typically worsen in situations that require sustained attention or mental effort or that lack intrinsic appeal or noveltylistening to classroom teachers doing class assignments listening to or reading lengthy materials or working on monotonous repetitive tasks signs of the disorder may be minimal or absent when the person is under very strict control is in a novel setting is engaged in especially interesting activities is in a one-to-one situationthe clinician's office or while the person experiences frequent rewards for appropriate behavior the symptoms are more likely
80 usually first diagnosed in infancy childhood or adolescence
to occur in group situationsin playgroups classrooms or work environments the clinician should therefore inquire about the individual's behavior in a variety of situations within each setting

3128 conduct disorder

the essential feature of conduct disorder is a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated criterion a these behaviors fall into four main groupings aggressive conduct that causes or threatens physical harm to other people or animals criteria a1-a7 nonaggressive conduct that causes property loss or damage criteria a8â€”a9 deceitful- ness or theft criteria a10-a12 and serious violations of rules criteria a13-a15 three or more characteristic behaviors must have been present during the past 12 months with at least one behavior present in the past 6 months the disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social academic or occupational functioning criterion b conduct disorder may be diagnosed in individuals who are older than age 18 years but only if the criteria for antisocial personality disorder are not met criterion c the behavior pattern is usually present in a variety of settings such as home school or the community because individuals with conduct disorder are likely to minimize their conduct problems the clinician often must rely on additional informants however the informant's knowledge of the child's conduct problems may be limited by inadequate supervision or by the child's not having revealed them
children or adolescents with this disorder often initiate aggressive behavior and react aggressively to others they may display bullying threatening or intimidating behavior criterion al initiate frequent physical fights criterion a2 use a weapon that can cause serious physical harma bat brick broken bottle knife or gun criterion a3 be physically cruel to people criterion a4 or animals criterion a5 steal while confronting a victimmugging purse snatching extortion or armed robbery criterion a6 or force someone into sexual activity criterion a7 physical violence may take the form of rape assault or in rare cases homicide

negativistic and defiant behaviors are expressed by persistent stubbornness resistance to directions and unwillingness to compromise give in or negotiate with adults or peers defiance may also include deliberate or persistent testing of limits usually by ignoring orders arguing and failing to accept blame for misdeeds hostility can be directed at adults or peers and is shown by deliberately annoying others or by verbal aggression usually without the more serious physical aggression seen in conduct disorder manifestations of the disorder are almost invariably present in the home setting but may not be evident at school or in the community symptoms of the disorder are typically more evident in interactions with adults or peers whom the individual knows well and thus may not be apparent during clinical examination usually individuals with this disorder do not regard themselves as oppositional or defiant but justify their behavior as a response to unreasonable demands or circumstances

30753 rumination disorder

the essential feature of rumination disorder is the repeated regurgitation and rechewing of food that develops in an infant or child after a period of normal functioning and lasts for at least 1 month criterion a partially digested food is brought up into the mouth without apparent nausea retching disgust or associated gastrointestinal disorder the food is then either ejected from the mouth or more frequently chewed and reswallowed the symptoms are not due to an associated gastrointestinal or other general medical conditionsandifer's syndrome esophageal reflux criterion b and do not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa if the symptoms occur exclusively during the course of mental retardation or a pervasive developmental disorder they must be sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention
criterion c the disorder is most commonly observed in infants but may be seen in older individuals particularly those who also have mental retardationinfants with the disorder display a characteristic position of straining and arching the back with the head held back make sucking movements with their tongues and give the impression of gaining satisfaction from the activity

30723 tourette's disorder

the essential features of tourette's disorder are multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics criterion a these may appear simultaneously or at different periods during the illness the tics occur many times a dayrecurrently throughout a period of more than 1 year criterion b during this period there is never a tic-free period of more than 3 consecutive months the disturbance causes marked distress or significant impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioningcriterion c the onset of the disorder is before age 18 years criterion d the tics are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substancestimulants or a general medical conditionhuntington's disease or postviral encephalitis criterion e
the anatomical location number frequency complexity and severity of the tics change over time the tics typically involve the head and frequently other parts of the body such as the torso and upper and lower limbs the vocal tics include various words or sounds such as clicks grunts yelps barks sniffs snorts and coughs coprolalia a complex vocal tic involving the uttering of obscenities is present in a few individuals less than 10% with this disorder complex motor tics involving touching squatting deep knee bends retracing steps and twirling when walking may be present in approximately one-half the individuals with this disorder the first symptoms to appear are bouts of a single tic most frequently eye blinking less frequently tics involving another part of the face or the body initial symptoms can also include tongue protrusion squatting sniffing hopping skipping throat clearing stuttering uttering sounds or
words and coprolalia the other cases begin with multiple symptoms

specifiers
the course of transient tic disorder may be indicated by specifying single episode or recurrent

the essential feature of selective mutism is the persistent failure to speak in specific social situationsschool with playmates where speaking is expected despite speaking in other situations criterion a the disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social communication criterion b the distur- bance must last for at least 1 month and is not limited to the first month of school during which many children may be shy and reluctant to speak criterion c selective mutism should not be diagnosed if the individual's failure to speak is due solely to a lack of knowledge of or comfort with the spoken language required in the social situation criterion d it is also not diagnosed if the disturbance is better accounted for by embarrassment related to having a communication disorderstuttering or if it occurs exclusively during a pervasive developmental disorder schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder criterion e instead of communicating by standard verbalization children with this disorder may communicate by gestures nodding or shaking the head or pulling or pushing or in some cases by monosyllabic short or monotone utterances or in an altered voice

31389 reactive attachment disorder of infancy or earlychildhood

the essential feature of reactive attachment disorder is markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts that begins before age 5 years and is associated with grossly pathological care criterion a there are two types of presentations in the inhibited type the child persistently fails to initiate and to respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate way the child shows a pattern of excessively inhibited hypervigilant or highly ambivalent responsesfrozen watchfulness resistance to comfort or a mixture of approach and avoidance criterion al in the disinhibited type there is a pattern of diffuse attachments the child exhibits indiscriminate sociability or a lack of selectivity in the choice of attachment figures criterion a2 the disturbance is not accounted for solely by developmental delayas in mental retardation and does not meet criteria for pervasive developmental disorder criterion b by definition the condition is associated with grossly pathological care that may take the form of persistent disregard of the child's basic emotional needs for comfort stimulation and affection criterion cl persistent disregard of the child's basic physical needs criterion c2or repeated changes of primary caregiver that prevent formation of stable attachmentsfrequent changes in foster care criterion c3the pathological care is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed social relatedness criterion d
3073 stereotypic movementdisorderformerly stereotypy/habit disorder 

the essential feature of stereotypic movement disorder is motor behavior that is repetitive often seemingly driven and nonfunctional criterion a this motor behavior markedly interferes with normal activities or results in self-inflicted bodily injury that is significant enough to require medical treatment or would result in such injury if protective measures were not used criterion b if mental retardation is present the stereotypic or self-injurious behavior is sufficiently severe to become a focus of treatment criterion c the behavior is not better accounted for by a compulsion as in obsessive-compulsive disorder a tic as in the tic disorders a stereotypy that is part of a pervasive developmental disorder or hair pulling as in trichotillomaniacriterion d the behavior is also not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition criterion e the motor behaviors must persist for at least 4 weeks criterion f
the stereotypic movements may include hand waving rocking playing with hands fiddling with fingers twirling objects head banging self-biting picking at skin or bodily orifices or hitting various parts of one's own body sometimes the individual uses an object in performing these behaviors the behaviors may cause permanent and disabling tissue damage and may sometimes be life-threatening for instance severe head banging or hitting may lead to cuts bleeding infection retinal detachment and blindness

delirium
the disorders in the delirium section share a common symptom presentation of a disturbance in consciousness and cognition but are differentiated based on etiology delirium due to a general medical condition substance-induced delirium including medication side effects and delirium due to multiple etiologies in addition delirium not otherwise specified is included in this section for presentations in which the clinician is unable to determine a specific etiology for the delirium

the essential feature of a delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in cognition that cannot be better accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia the disturbance develops over a short period of time usually hours to days and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day there is evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory tests that the delirium is a direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition substance intoxication or withdrawal use of a medication or toxin exposure or a combination of these factors
the disturbance in consciousness is manifested by a reduced clarity of awareness of the environment the ability to focus sustain or shift attention is impaired criterion a questions must be repeated because the individual's attention wanders or the individual may perseverate with an answer to a previous question rather than appropriately shift attention the person is easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli because of these problems it may be difficult or impossible to engage the person in conversation
there is an accompanying change in cognition which may include memory impairment disorientation or language disturbance or development of a perceptual disturbance criterion b memory impairment is most commonly evident in recent memory and can be tested by asking the person to remember several unrelated objects or a brief sentence and then to repeat them after a few minutes of distraction disorientation is usually manifested by the individual being disoriented to timethinking it is morning in the middle of the night or being disoriented to placethinking he or she is home rather than in a hospital in mild delirium disorientation to time may be the first symptom to appear disorientation to self is less common language disturbance may be evident as dysnomia ie the impaired ability to name objects or dysgraphia ie the impaired ability to write in some cases speech is rambling and irrelevant in others pressured and incoherent with unpredictable switching from subject to subject it may be difficult for the clinician to assess for changes in cognitive function because the individual may be inattentive and incoherent under these circumstances it is helpful to review carefully the individual's history and to obtain information from other informantsparticularly family members
perceptual disturbances may include misinterpretations illusions or hallucinations for example the banging of a door may be mistaken for a gunshot misinterpretation the folds of the bedclothes may appear to be animate objects illusion or the person may see a group of people hovering over the bed when no one is actually there hallucination although sensory misperceptions are most commonly visual they may occur in other sensory modalities as well misperceptions range from simple and uniform to highly complex the individual may have a delusional conviction of the reality of the hallucinations and exhibit emotional and behavioral responses in keeping with their content
the disturbance develops over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day criterion c for example during morning hospital rounds the person may be coherent and cooperative but at night might insist on pulling out intravenous lines and going home to parents who died years ago

2930 delirium due to a general medical condition
diagnostic and associated features
the descriptive features of delirium due to a general medical condition criteria a -c  are discussed on pp 124-125 in addition to diagnose delirium due to a general medical condition there must be evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory findings that the cognitive disturbance is the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition criterion d
in determining whether the delirium is due to a general medical condition the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical condition further the clinician must establish that the delirium is etiologically related to the general medical condition a careful and comprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment although there are no infallible guidelines several considerations provide some guidance in this area one consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset exacerbation or remission of the general medical condition and that of the delirium evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a direct association between the general medical condition in question and the development of a delirium can provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation in addition the clinician must also judge that the disturbance is not better accounted for by a substance-induced delirium or a primary mental disordera manic episode this determination is explained in greater detail in the mental disorders due to a general medical condition section p 165
delirium can be associated with many different general medical conditions each of which has characteristic physical examination and laboratory findings in systemic illnesses focal neurological signs are not usually found various forms of tremor may be present asterixis a flapping movement of the hyperextended hands was originally described in hepatic encephalopathy but may also be found in association with other causes of delirium signs of autonomic hyperactivitytachycardia sweating flushed face dilated pupils and elevated blood pressure commonly occur in addition to laboratory findings that are characteristic of etiological general medical conditions or intoxication or withdrawal states the eeg is generally abnormal showing either generalized slowing or fast activity

134 delirium dementia and amnestic and other cognitive disorders

the essential feature of a dementia is the development of multiple cognitive deficits that include memory impairment and at least one of the following cognitive disturbances aphasia apraxia agnosia or a disturbance in executive functioning the cognitive deficits must be sufficiently severe to cause impairment in occupational or social functioning and must represent a decline from a previously higher level of functioning a diagnosis of a dementia should not be made if the cognitive deficits occur exclusively during the course of a delirium however a dementia and a delirium may both be diagnosed if the dementia is present at times when the delirium is not present dementia may be etiologically related to a general medical condition to the persisting effects of substance use including toxin exposure or to a combination of these factors
memory impairment is required to make the diagnosis of a dementia and is a prominent early symptom criterion al individuals with dementia become impaired in their ability to learn new material or they forget previously learned material most individuals with dementia have both forms of memory impairment although it is sometimes difficult to demonstrate the loss of previously learned material early in the course of the disorder they may lose valuables like wallets and keys forget food cooking on the stove and become lost in unfamiliar neighborhoods in advanced stages of dementia memory impairment is so severe that the person forgets his or her occupation schooling birthday family members and sometimes even name
memory may be formally tested by asking the person to register retain recall and recognize information the ability to learn new information may be assessed by asking the individual to learn a list of words the individual is requested to repeat the words registration to recall the information after a delay of several minutes retention recall and to recognize the words from a multiple list recognition individuals with difficulty learning new information are not helped by clues or promptsmultiple-choice questions because they did not learn the material initially in contrast individuals with primarily retrieval deficits can be helped by clues and prompts because their impairment is in the ability to access their memories remote memory may be tested by asking the individual to recall personal information or past material that the individual found of interestpolitics sports entertainment it is also useful to determine from the individual and informants the impact of the memory disturbances on the individual's functioningability to work shop cook pay bills return home without getting lost
deterioration of language function aphasia may be manifested by difficulty producing the names of individuals and objects criterion a2a the speech of individuals with aphasia may become vague or empty with long circumlocutory phrases and excessive use of terms of indefinite reference such as thing and it comprehension of spoken and written language and repetition of language may also be compromised in the advanced stages of dementia individuals may be mute or have a deteriorated speech pattern characterized by echolalia ie echoing what is heard or palilalia ie repeating sounds or words over and over language is tested by asking the individual to name objects in the roomtie dress desk lamp or body partsnose chin shoulder follow commands point at the door and then at the table or repeat phrases no ifs ands or buts
individuals with dementia may exhibit apraxia ie impaired ability to execute motor activities despite intact motor abilities sensory function and comprehension of the required task criterion a2b they will be impaired in their ability to pantomime the use of objectscombing hair or to execute known motor actswaving
goodbye apraxia may contribute to deficits in cooking dressing and drawing motor skill disturbances may be tested by asking the individual to execute motor functionsto show how to brush teeth to copy intersecting pentagons to assemble blocks or to arrange sticks in specific designs
individuals with dementia may exhibit agnosia ie failure to recognize or identify objects despite intact sensory function criterion a2c for example the individual may have normal visual acuity but lose the ability to recognize objects such as chairs or pencils eventuallythey may be unable to recognize family members or even their own reflection in the mirror similarly they may have normal tactile sensation but be unable to identify objects placed in their hands by touch alonea coin or keys
disturbances in executive functioning are a common manifestation of dementia criterion a2d and may be related especially to disorders of the frontal lobe or associated subcortical pathways executive functioning involves the ability to think abstractly and to plan initiate sequence monitor and stop complex behavior impairment in abstract thinking may be manifested by the individual having difficulty coping with novel tasks and avoiding situations that require the processing of new and complex information the ability to abstract can be formally assessed by asking the person to find similarities or differences between related words executive dysfunction is also evident in a reduced ability to shift mental sets to generate novel verbal or nonverbal information and to execute serial motor activities tests for executive function include asking the individual to count to 10 recite the alphabet subtract serial 7s state as many animals as possible in 1 minute or draw a continuous line consisting of alternating m's and n's it is also useful to determine from the individual and informants the impact of the disturbances in executive functioning on the individual's daily lifeability to work plan activities budget
the items in both criterion al memory impairment and criterion a2 aphasia apraxia agnosia or disturbance in executive functioning must be severe enough to cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioninggoing to school working shopping dressing bathing handling finances and other activities of daily living and must represent a decline from a previous level of functioning criterion b the nature and degree of impairment are variable and often depend on the particular social setting of the individual the same level of cognitive impairment may significantly impair an individual's ability to perform a complex jobbut not a job that is less demanding standardized published rating scales that measure physical maintenancepersonal hygiene intellectual functioning and the ability to use implements or toolstelephone washing machine can be used to measure the severity of impairment
dementia is not diagnosed if these symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium however a delirium may be superimposed on a preexisting dementia in which case both diagnoses should be given

dementia of the alzheimer's type

the cognitive deficits criterion a and the required impairment criterion b are discussed on pp 133-135 the onset of dementia of the alzheimer's type is gradual and involves continuing cognitive decline criterion c because of the difficulty of obtaining direct pathological evidence of the presence of alzheimer's disease the diagnosis can be made only when other etiologies for the dementia have been ruled out specifically the cognitive deficits are not due to other central nervous system conditions that cause progressive deficits in memory or cognitioncerebrovascular disease parkinson's disease huntington's disease systemic conditions that are known to cause dementiahypothyroidism vitamin b12 deficiency hiv infection or the persisting effects of a substancealcohol criterion d if there is an additional etiologyhead trauma worsening a dementia of the alzheimer's type both types of dementia should be coded see dementia due to multiple etiologies p 154 dementia of the alzheimer's type should not be diagnosed if the symptoms occur exclusively during delirium criterion e however delirium may be superimposed on a preexisting dementia of the alzheimer's type in which case the with delirium subtype should be indicated finally the cognitive deficits are not better accounted for by another axis i disordermajor depressive disorder or schizophrenia criterion f

2904x vascular dementia
multi-infarct dementia
the cognitive deficits criterion a and the required impairment criterion b in vascular dementia are discussed on pp 133-135 there must be evidence of cerebrovascular disease ie focal neurological signs and symptoms or laboratory evidence

judged to be etiologically related to the dementia criterion c the focal neurological signs and symptoms include extensor plantar response pseudobulbar palsy gait abnormalities exaggeration of deep tendon reflexes or weakness of an extremity computed tomography ct of the head and magnetic resonance imaging mri usually demonstrate multiple vascular lesions of the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures vascular dementia is not diagnosed if the symptoms occur exclusively during delirium criterion d however delirium may be superimposed on a preexisting vascular dementia in which case the subtype with delirium should be indicated

2941 dementia due to huntington's disease
the essential feature of dementia due to huntington's disease is the presence of a dementia that is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of huntington's disease huntington's disease is an inherited progressive degenerative disease of cognition emotion and movement the disease affects men and women equally and is transmitted by a single autosomal dominant gene on the short arm of chromosome 4 the disease is usually diagnosed in the late 30s to early 40s but may begin as early as age 4 years in the juvenile form or as late as age 85 years in the late-onset form the onset of huntington's disease is often heralded by insidious changes in behavior and personality including depression irritability and anxiety some individuals present with abnormalities of movement that resemble increased fidgeting and that later progress to characteristic generalized choreoathetosis difficulties with memory retrieval executive functioning and judgment are common early in the course with more severe memory deficits occurring as the disease progresses disorganized speech and psychotic features are sometimes present late in the disease characteristic boxcar ventriclesmay be seen on structural brain imaging due to the atrophy of the striatum positron-emission tomography pet may show striatal hypometabolism early in the disease offspring of individuals with huntington's disease have a 50% chance of developing the disease a genetic test is available to determine with relative certainty whether a given at-risk individual is likely to develop the disease however such testing may be best administered by centers with experience in counseling and follow-up of individuals at risk for huntington's disease
29010 dementia due to pick's disease
the essential feature of dementia due to pick's disease is the presence of a dementia that is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of pick's disease pick's disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that particularly affects the frontal and temporal lobes as in other frontal lobe dementias pick's disease is characterized clinically by changes in personality early in the course deterioration of social skills emotional blunting behavioral disinhibition and prominent language abnormalities difficulties with memory apraxia and other features of dementia usually follow later in the course prominent primitive reflexes snout suck grasp may be present as the dementia progresses it may be accompanied by either apathy or extreme agitation individuals may develop such severe problems in language attention or behavior that it may be difficult to assess their degree of cognitive impairment structural brain imaging typically reveals prominent frontal and/or temporal atrophy and functional brain imaging may localize frontotemporal hypometabolism even in the absence of clear structural atrophy the disorder most commonly manifests itself in individuals between ages 50 and 60 years although it can occur among older individualspick's disease is one of the pathologically distinct etiologies among the heterogeneous group of dementing processes that are associated with frontotemporal brain atrophy the specific diagnosis of a frontal lobe dementia such as pick's disease is usually established at autopsy with the pathological finding of characteristic intraneuronal argentophilic pick inclusion bodies clinically pick's disease often cannot be distinguished with certainty from atypical cases of alzheimer's disease or from other dementias that affect the frontal lobes

29010 dementia due to creutzfeldt-jakob disease
the essential feature of dementia due to creutzfeldt-jakob disease is the presence of a dementia that is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of creutzfeldt- jakob disease jacob-creutzfeldt disease is one of the subacute spongiform encephalopathies a group of central nervous system diseases caused by transmissible agents known as slow viruses or prions typicallyindividuals with creutzfeldt-jakob disease manifest the clinical triad of dementia involuntary movements particularly myoclonus and periodic eec activity however up to 25%of individuals with the disorder may have atypical presentations and the disease can be confirmed only by biopsy or at autopsy with the demonstration of spongiform neuropathological changes creutzfeldt-jakob disease may develop at any age in adults but most typically when they are between ages 40 and 60 years from 5%to 15% of cases may have a familial component prodromal symptoms of creutzfeldt-jakob disease may include fatigue anxiety or problems with appetite sleeping or concentration and may be followed after several weeks by incoordination altered vision or abnormal gait or other movements that may be myoclonic choreoathetoid or ballistic along with a rapidly progressive dementia the disease typically progresses very rapidly over several months although more rarely it can progress over years and appear similar in its course to other dementias there are no distinctive findings on cerebrospinal fluid analysis and nonspecific atrophy may be apparent on neuroimaging in most individuals the eec typically reveals periodic sharp often triphasic and synchronous discharges at a rate of 05-2 hz at some point during the course of the disorder the transmissible agent thought to be responsible for creutzfeldt-jakob disease is resistant to boiling formalin alcohol and ultraviolet radiation but it can be inactivated by pressured autoclaving or by bleach transmission by corneal transplantation and human growth factor injection has been documented and anecdotal cases of transmission to health care workers have been reported therefore when neurosurgery brain biopsy or brain autopsy is undertaken
universal precautions should be taken with both tissue and equipment that comes in contact with tissue

29389 catatonic disorder due to a general medical condition

the essential feature of catatonic disorder due to a general medical condition is the presence of catatonia that is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition catatonia is manifested by any of the following motoric immobility excessive motor activity extreme negativism or mutism peculiarities of voluntary movement echolalia or echopraxia criterion a there must be evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory findings that the catatonia is the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition criterion b the diagnosis is not given if the catatonia is better accounted for by another mental disordermanic episode criterion c or if it occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium criterion d
motoric immobility may be manifested by catalepsy waxy flexibility or stupor the excessive motor activity is apparently purposeless and is not influenced by external stimuli there may be extreme negativism that is manifested by resistance to all instructions or the maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved peculiarities of voluntary movement are manifested by the voluntary assumption of inappropriate or bizarre postures or by prominent grimacing echolalia is the pathological parrotlike and apparently senseless repetition of a word or phrase just spoken by another person echopraxia is the repetitive imitation of the movements of another person

3101 personality change
due to a general medical condition

the essential feature of a personality change due to a general medical condition is a persistent personality disturbance that is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition the personality disturbance represents a change from the individual's previous characteristic personality pattern in children this condition may be manifested as a marked deviation from normal development rather than as a change in a stable personality pattern criterion a there must be evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory findings that the personality change is the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition criterion b the diagnosis is not given if the disturbance is better accounted for by another mental disorder criterion c the diagnosis is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium or if symptoms meet the criteria for a dementia criterion d the disturbance must also cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion e
common manifestations of the personality change include affective instability poor impulse control outbursts of aggression or rage grossly out of proportion to any precipitating psychosocial stressor marked apathy suspiciousness or paranoid ideation the phenomenology of the change is indicated using the subtypes listed below an individual with the disorder is often characterized by others as not himself [or herself] although it shares the term personality with the axis ii personality disorders this diagnosis is coded on axis i and is distinct by virtue of its specific etiology different phenomenology and more variable onset and course
the clinical presentation in a given individual may depend on the nature and localization of the pathological process for example injury to the frontal lobes may yield such symptoms as lack of judgment or foresight facetiousness disinhibition and euphoria right hemisphere strokes have often been shown to evoke personality changes in association with unilateral spatial neglect anosognosia inability of the individual to recognize a bodily or functional deficit such as the existence of hemiparesis motor impersistence and other neurological deficits

2939 mental disorder not otherwise specified due to a general medical condition
this residual category should be used for situations in which it has been established that the disturbance is caused by the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition but the criteria are not met for a specific mental disorder due to a general medical conditiondissociative symptoms due to complex partial seizures


30390 alcohol dependence
also refer to the text and criteria for substance dependence see p 176 physiological dependence on alcohol is indicated by evidence of tolerance or symptoms of withdrawal alcohol withdrawal see p 197 is characterized by the development of withdrawal symptoms 12 hours or so after the reduction of intake following prolonged heavy alcohol ingestion because withdrawal from alcohol can be unpleasant and intense individuals with alcohol dependence may continue to consume alcohol despite adverse consequences often to avoid or to relieve the symptoms of withdrawal a substantial minority of individuals who have alcohol dependence never experience clinically relevant levels of alcohol withdrawal and only about 5% of individuals with alcohol dependence ever experience severe complications of withdrawal egdelirium grandmal seizures once a pattern of compulsive use develops individuals with dependence may devote substantial periods of time to obtaining and consuming alcoholic beverages these individuals often continue to use alcohol despite evidence of adverse psychological or physical consequencesdepression blackouts liver disease or other sequelae

30500 alcohol abuse
also refer to the text and criteria for substance abuse see p 182 school and job performance may suffer either from the aftereffects of drinking or from actual intoxication on the job or at school child care or household responsibilities may be neglected and alcohol-related absences may occur from school or job the person may use alcohol in physically hazardous circumstancesdriving an automobile or operating machinery while drunk legal difficulties may arise because of alcohol usearrests for intoxicated behavior or for driving under the influence finally individuals with alcohol abuse may continue to consume alcohol despite the knowledge that continued consumption poses significant social or interpersonal problems for themviolent arguments with spouse while intoxicated child abuse when these problems are accompanied by evidence of tolerance withdrawal or compulsive behavior related to alcohol use a diagnosis of alcohol dependence rather than alcohol abuse should be considered

30300 alcohol intoxication
refer to the text and criteria for substance intoxication see p 183 the essential feature of alcohol intoxication is the presence of clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changesinappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior mood lability impaired judgment impaired social or occupational functioning that develop during or shortly after the ingestion of alcohol criteria a and b these changes are accompanied by evidence of slurred speech incoordination unsteady gait nystagmus impairment in attention or memory or stupor or coma criterion c the symptoms must not be due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another
mental disorder criterion d the resulting picture is similar to what is observed during benzodiazepine or barbiturate intoxication the levels of incoordination can interfere with driving abilities and with performing usual activities to the point of causing accidents evidence of alcohol use can be obtained by smelling alcohol on the individual's breath eliciting a history from the individual or another observer and when needed having the individual undertake breath blood or urine toxicology analyses

2919 alcohol-related disorder not otherwise specified
the alcohol-related disorder not otherwise specified category is for disorders associated with the use of alcohol that are not classifiable as alcohol dependence alcohol abuse alcohol intoxication alcohol withdrawal alcohol intoxication delirium alcohol withdrawal delirium alcohol-induced persisting dementia alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder alcohol-induced psychotic disorder alcohol-induced mood disorder alcohol-induced anxiety disorder alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction or alcohol-induced sleep disorder

30420 cocaine dependence
also refer to the text and criteria for substance dependence see p 176 cocaine has extremely potent euphoric effects and individuals exposed to it can develop dependence after using cocaine for very short periods of time an early sign of cocaine dependence is when the individual finds it increasingly difficult to resist using cocaine whenever it is available because of its short half-life there is a need for frequent dosing to maintain a high persons with cocaine dependence can spend extremely large amounts of money on the drug within a very short period of time as a result the person using the substance may become involved in theft prostitution or drug dealing or may request salary advances to obtain funds to purchase the drug individuals with cocaine dependence often find it necessary to discontinue use for several days to rest or to obtain additional funds important responsibilities such as work or child care may be grossly neglected to obtain or use cocaine mental or physical complications of chronic use such as paranoid ideation aggressive behavior anxiety depression and weight loss are common regardless of the route of administration tolerance occurs with repeated use withdrawal symptoms particularly dysphoric mood can be seen but are usually transitory and associated with high-dose use

30560 cocaine abuse
also refer to the text and criteria for substance abuse see p 182 the intensity and frequency of cocaine administration is less in cocaine abuse as compared with dependence episodes of problematic use neglect of responsibilities and interpersonal conflict often occur around paydays or special occasions resulting in a pattern of brief periods hours to a few days of high-dose use followed by much longer periods weeks to months of occasional nonproblematic use or abstinence legal difficulties may result from possession or use of the drug when the problems associated with use are accompanied by evidence of tolerance withdrawal or compulsive behavior related to obtaining and administering cocaine a diagnosis of cocaine dependence rather than cocaine abuse should be considered


29289 cocaine intoxication
also refer to the text and criteria for substance intoxication see p 183 the essential feature of cocaine intoxication is the presence of clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes that develop during or shortly after use of cocaine criteria a and b cocaine intoxication usually begins with a high feeling and includes one or more of the following euphoria with enhanced vigor gregariousness hyper- activity restlessness hypervigilance interpersonal sensitivity talkativeness anxiety tension alertness grandiosity stereotyped and repetitive behavior anger and impaired judgment and in the case of chronic intoxication affective blunting with fatigue or sadness and social withdrawal these behavioral and psychological changes are accompanied by two or more of the following signs and symptoms that develop during or shortly after cocaine use tachycardia or bradycardia pupillary dilation elevated or lowered blood pressure perspiration or chills nausea or vomiting evidence of weight loss psychomotor agitation or retardation muscular weakness respiratory depression chest pain or cardiac arrhythmias and confusion seizures dyskinesias dystonias or coma criterion c intoxication either acute or chronic is often associated with impaired social or occupational functioning severe intoxication can lead to coma to make a

2920 cocaine withdrawal
also refer to the text and criteria for substance withdrawal see p 184 the essential feature of cocaine withdrawal is the presence of a characteristicwithdrawal syndrome that develops within a few hours to several days after the cessation of or reduction in cocaine use that has been heavy and prolonged criteria a and b the withdrawal syndrome is characterized by the development of dysphoric mood accompanied by two or more of the following physiological changes fatigue vivid and unpleasant dreams insomnia or hypersomnia increased appetite and psychomotor retardation or agitation anhedonia and drug craving can often be present but are not part of the diagnostic criteria these symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion c the symptoms must not be due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder criterion d
acute withdrawal symptoms a crash are often seen after periods of repetitive high-dose use runs or binges these periods are characterized by intense and unpleasant feelings of lassitude and depression generally requiring several days of rest and recuperation depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation or behavior can occur and are generally the most serious problems seen during crashing or other forms of cocaine withdrawal a substantial number of individuals with cocaine dependence have few or no clinically evident withdrawal symptoms on cessation of use

2929 cocaine-related disorder not otherwise specified
the cocaine-related disorder not otherwise specified category is for disorders associ- ated with the use of cocaine that are not classifiable as cocaine dependence cocaine abuse cocaine intoxication cocaine withdrawal cocaine intoxication delirium cocaine-induced psychotic disorder cocaine-induced mood disorder cocaine- induced anxiety disorder cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction or cocaine-induced sleep disorder

specifiers
the following specifiers may be applied to a diagnosis of hallucinogen dependence see p 179 for more details
early full remission
early partial remission sustained full remission sustained partial remission in a controlled environment
30530 hallucinogen abuse
also refer to the text and criteria for substance abuse seep 182persons who abuse hallucinogens use them much less often than do those with dependence however they may repeatedly fail to fulfill major role obligations at school work or home due to behavioral impairment caused by hallucinogen intoxication the individual may use hallucinogens in situations in which it is physically hazardouswhile driving a motorcycle or a carand legal difficulties may arise clue to behaviors that result from intoxication or possession of hallucinogens there may be recurrent social or interper- sonal problems due to the individual's behavior while intoxicated isolated lifestyle or arguments with significant others

also refer to the text and criteria for substance intoxication see p 183 the essential feature of hallucinogen intoxication is the presence of clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changesmarked anxiety or depression ideas of reference fear of losing one's mind paranoid ideation impaired judgment or impaired social or occupational functioning that develop during or shortly after within minutes to a few hours hallucinogen use criteria a and b perceptual changes develop during or shortly after hallucinogen use and occur in a state of full wakefulness and alertness criterion c these changes include subjective intensification of perceptions deperson- alization derealization illusions hallucinations and synesthesias in addition the diagnosis requires that two of the following physiological signs are also present pupillary dilation tachycardia sweating palpitations blurring of vision tremors and incoordina- tion criterion d the symptoms must not be due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder criterion e
hallucinogen intoxication usually begins with some stimulant effects such as restlessness and autonomic activation nausea may occur a sequence of experiences then follows with higher doses producing more intense symptoms feelings of euphoria may alternate rapidly with depression or anxiety initial visual illusions or enhanced sensory experience may give way to hallucinations at low doses the perceptual changes frequently do not include hallucinations synesthesias a blending of senses may result for example in sounds being seen the hallucinations are usually visual often of geometric forms or figures sometimes of persons and objects more rarely auditory or tactile hallucinations are experienced in most cases reality testing is preserved ie the individual knows that the effects are substance induced

29289 hallucinogen persisting perception disorder flashbacks
the essential feature of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder flashbacks is the transient recurrence of disturbances in perception that are reminiscent of those experi- enced during one or more earlier hallucinogen intoxications the person must have had no recent hallucinogen intoxication and must show no current drug toxicity criterion a this reexperiencing of perceptual symptoms causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion b the symptoms are not due to a general medical conditionanatomical lesions and infections of the brain or visual epilepsies and are not better accounted for by another mental disorderdelirium dementia or schizophrenia or by hypno- pompic hallucinations criterion c the perceptual disturbances may include geometric forms peripheral-field images flashes of color intensified colors trailing images images left suspended in the path of a moving object as seen in stroboscopic photography perceptions of entire objects afterimages a same-colored or complementary-colored shadow of an object remaining after removal of the object halos around objects macropsia and micropsia the abnormal perceptions that are associated with halluci- nogen persisting perception disorder occur episodically and may be self-inducedby thinking about them or triggered by entry into a dark environment various drugs anxiety or fatigue or other stressors the episodes may abate after several months but many persons report persisting episodes for 5 years or longer reality testing remains intact ie the person recognizes that the perception is a drug effect and does not represent external reality in contrast if the person has a delusional interpretation concerning the etiology of the perceptual disturbance the appropriate diagnosis would be psychotic disorder not otherwise specified

additional information on hallucinogen-related disorders
associated features and disorders
when intoxicated with a hallucinogen individuals may be voluble and discursive and show rapid alternation of moods tearfulness and anxiety may become intense with dread of insanity or death many hallucinogenic substances have stimulant effectstachycardia mild hypertension hyperthermia and pupillary dilation and may cause some of the features of amphetamine intoxication the perceptual disturbances and impaired judgment associated with hallucinogen intoxication may result in injuries or fatalities from automobile accidents physical fights or attempts to fly from high places environmental factors and the personality and expectations of the individual using the hallucinogen may contribute to the nature and severity of hallucinogen intoxication
hallucinogen-related disorders 235
hallucinogen persisting perception disorder may produce considerable anxiety and concern and may be more common in suggestible persons hallucinogen dependence and abuse may co-occur with chronic psychotic conditions it remains controversial whether the chronic hallucinogen use produces a psychotic disorder de novo triggers psychotic symptoms only in vulnerable persons or is simply an early and continuing sign of an evolving psychotic process hallucinogen abuse and dependence also frequently occur in persons with preexisting adolescent conduct disorder or adult antisocial personality disorder lsd intoxication may be confirmed by urine toxicology
specific culture age and gender features
hallucinogens may be used as part of established religious practices within the united states there are regional differences in their use hallucinogen intoxication usually first occurs in adolescence and younger users may tend to experience more disruptive emotions hallucinogen use and intoxication appear to be three times more common among males than among females
prevalence
a community survey conducted in the united states in 1991 reported that 8% of the population had used hallucinogens or phencyclidine pgp at least one or more times in their lifetime the cohort with the highest lifetime use was persons ages 26-34 years among whom 26% had ever tried hallucinogens however recent use was most common among those ages 18-25 years with 2% of this group having used hallucinogens within the last month a community study conducted in the united states from 1980 to 1985 that used the more narrowly defined dsm-iii criteria found that about 03% of the adult population had hallucinogen abuse at some time in their lives
course
hallucinogen intoxication may be a brief and isolated event or may occur repeatedly the intoxication may be prolonged if doses are frequently repeated during an episode frequent dosing however tends to reduce the intoxicating effects because of the development of tolerance depending on the drug and its route of administration peak effects occur within a few minutes to a few hours and intoxication ends within a few hours to a few days after dosing ends the high prevalence of ever having used hallucinogens among those ages 26-34 years and the lower prevalence of recent use in that group suggest that many individuals may stop using hallucinogens as they get older some individuals who use hallucinogen report flashbacks that are not associated with any impairment or distress on the other hand flashbacks can cause impairment or distress in some individuals hallucinogen persisting perception disorder see above
differential diagnosisfor a general discussion of the differential diagnosis of substance-related disorders see p 190 hallucinogen-induced disorders may be characterized by symptoms eg
236 substance-related disorders
delusions that resemble primarymental disordersschizophreniform disorder versus hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder with delusions with onset during intoxication see p 193 for a discussion of this differential diagnosis
hallucinogen intoxication should be differentiated from amphetamine or phen- cyclidine intoxication toxicological tests are useful in making this distinction intoxication with anticholinergics can also produce hallucinations but they are often associated with physical findings of fever dry mouth and skin flushed face and visual disturbances hallucinogen intoxication is distinguished from the other hallucinogen- induced disordershallucinogen-induced anxiety disorder with onset during intoxication because the symptoms in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with hallucinogen intoxication and are severe enough to warrant indepen- dent clinicalattention
hallucinogen intoxication is distinguished from hallucinogen persisting percep- tion disorder flashbacks by the fact that the latter continues episodically for weeks or longer after the most recent intoxication in hallucinogen persisting perception disorder the individual does not believe that the perception represents external reality whereas a person with a psychotic disorder often believes that the perception is real hallucinogen persisting perception disorder may be distinguished from migraine epilepsy or a neurological condition by neuro-ophthalmological history physical examination and appropriate laboratory evaluation
2929 hallucinogen-related disorder not otherwise specified
the hallucinogen-related disorder not otherwise specified category is for disorders associated with the use of hallucinogens that are not classifiable as hallucinogen dependence hallucinogen abuse hallucinogen intoxication hallucinogen persisting perception disorder hallucinogen intoxication delirium hallucinogen-induced psy- chotic disorder hallucinogen-induced mood disorder or hallucinogen-induced anxi- ety disorder
inhalanrelated disorders
this section includes disorders induced by inhaling the aliphatic and aromatic hydro- carbons found in substances such as gasoline glue paint thinners and spray paints less commonly used are halogenated hydrocarbons found in cleaners typewriter correction fluid spray-can propellants and other volatile compounds containing esters ketones and glycols most compounds that are inhaled are a mixture of several substances that can produce psychoactive effects and it is often difficult to ascertain the exact substance responsible for the disorder unless there is clear evidence that a single unmixed substance has been used the general term inhalant should be used in recording the diagnosis these volatile substances are available in a wide variety of commercial products and may be used interchangeably depending on availabilityand personal preference although there may be subtle differences in the psychoactive and physical effects of the different compounds not enough is known about their differential
effects to distinguish among them all are capable of producing dependence abuse and intoxication
several methods are used to inhale intoxicating vapors most commonly a rag soaked with the substance is applied to the mouth and nose and the vapors are breathed in the substance may also be placed in a paper or plastic bag and the gases in the bag inhaled substances may also be inhaled directly from containers or from aerosols sprayed in the mouth or nose there are reports of individuals heating these compounds to accelerate vaporization the inhalants reach the lungs bloodstream and target sites very rapidly

associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders individuals with inhalant intoxication may present with auditory visual or tactile hallucinations or other percep- tual disturbances macropsia micropsia illusionary misperceptions alterations in time perception delusions such as believing one can fly may develop during periods of inhalant intoxication especially those characterized by marked confusion in some cases these delusions may be acted on with resultant injury anxiety may also be present repeated but episodic intake of inhalants may first be associated with school problemstruancy poor grades dropping out of school as well as family conflict use by older adolescents and young adults is often associated with social and work problemsdelinquency unemployment most commonly inhalants are used by adolescents in a group setting solitary use tends to be more typical of those with long-term heavy use the use of inhalants as the predominant substance among those seeking help for substance dependence appears to be rare but inhalants may be a secondary drug used by individuals with dependence on other substances in some individuals there may be a progression to a stage at which inhalants become the preferred substance
associated laboratory findings direct assay for inhalants is rarely used clinically and is generally not part of routine screening for drugs of abuse damage to muscles kidneys liver and other organs can result in laboratory tests being indicative of these pathological conditions
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
the odor of paint or solvents may be present on the breath or clothes of individuals who use inhalants or there may be a residue of the substance on clothing or skin a glue sniffer's rash may be evident around the nose and mouth and conjunctival irritation may be noted there may be evidence of trauma due to disinhibited behavior or burns due to the flammable nature of these compounds nonspecific respiratory findings include evidence of upper- or lower-airway irritation including coughing sinus discharge dyspnea rales or rhonchi rarely cyanosis may result from pneumonitis or asphyxia there may also be headache generalized weakness abdominal pain nausea and vomiting inhalants can cause both central and peripheral nervous system damage
which may be permanent examination of the individual who chronically uses inhalants may reveal a number of neurological deficits including generalized weakness and peripheral neuropathies cerebral atrophy cerebellar degeneration and white matter lesions resulting in cranial nerve or pyramidal tract signs have been reported among individuals with heavy use recurrent use may lead to the development of hepatitis which may progress to cirrhosis or metabolic acidosis consistent with distal renal tubular acidosis chronic renal failure hepatorenal syndrome and proximal renal tubular acidosis have also been reported as has bone marrow suppression some inhalantsmethylene chloride may be metabolized to carbon monoxide death may occur from respiratory or cardiovasculardepression in particularsudden sniffing death may result from acute arrhythmiahypoxia or electrolyte abnormalities
specific culture age and gender features
because of their low cost and easy availability inhalants are often the first drugs of experimentation for young people and there may be a higher incidence among those living in economically depressed areas inhalant use may begin by ages 9-12 years appears to peak in adolescence and is less common after age 35 years males account for 70%-80% of inhalant-related emergency-room visits
prevalence
inhalant dependence and abuse appear to occur in only a small proportion of individuals who use inhalants
course
it can be difficult to match inhalant dose to effect because the different methods of administration and the varying concentrations of inhalants in the products used cause highly variable concentrations in the body the time course of inhalant intoxication is related to the pharmacological characteristics of the specific substance used but it is typically brief lasting from a few minutes to an hour onset is rapid peaking within a few minutes after inhalingyounger children diagnosed as having inhalant dependence may use inhalants several times a week often on weekends and after school severe dependence in adults may involve varying periods of intoxication throughout each day and occasional periods of heavier use that may last several days this pattern may persist for years with recurrent need for treatment individuals who use inhalants may have a preferred level or degree of intoxication and the method of administrationtypically sniffing from a container or breathing through a rag soaked in the substance may allow the individual to maintain that level for several hours cases have also been reported of the development of dependence in industrial workers who have long-term occupational exposure and access to inhalants a worker may begin to use the compound for its psychoactive effects and subsequently develop a pattern of dependence use leading to dependence may also occur in people who do not have access to other substancesprisoners isolated military personnel and adolescents or young adults in isolated rural areasinhalant-related disorders 241

differential diagnosis
for a general discussion of the differential diagnosis of substance-related disorders see p 190 inhalant-induced disorders may be characterized by symptomsdepressed mood that resemble primary mental disordersmajor depressive disorder versus inhalant-induced mood disorder with depressive features with onset during intoxication see p 193 for a discussion of this differential diagnosis
the symptoms of mild to moderate inhalant intoxication can be similar to those of alcohol intoxication and sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication breath odor or residues on body or clothing may be important differentiating clues but should not be relied on exclusively individuals who chronically use inhalants are likely to use other substances frequently and heavily further complicating the diagnostic picture concomitant use of alcohol may also make the differentiation difficult history of the drug used and characteristic findings including odor of solvent or paint residue may differentiate inhalant intoxication from other substance intoxications additionally symptoms may subside faster with inhalant intoxication than with other substance intoxications rapid onset and resolution may also differentiate inhalant intoxication from other mental disorders and neurological conditions inhalant intoxication is distinguished from the other inhalant-induced disordersinhalant-induced mood disorder with onset during intoxication because the symptoms in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with inhalant intoxication and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention
industrial workers may occasionally be accidentally exposed to volatile chemi- cals and suffer physiological intoxication the category other substance-related disorders should be used for such toxin exposures

nicotine-related disorders
nicotine dependence and withdrawal can develop with use of all forms of tobacco cigarettes chewing tobacco snuff pipes and cigars and with prescription medications nicotine gum and patch the relative ability of these products to produce dependence or to induce withdrawal is associated with the rapidity characteristic of the route of administration smoked over oral over transdermal and the nicotine content of the product

2920 nicotine withdrawal
also refer to the text and criteria for substance withdrawal see p 184 the essential feature of nicotine withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the abrupt cessation of or reduction in the use of nicotine-containing products following a prolonged period at least several weeks of daily use criteriaa and b the withdrawal syndrome includes four or more of the following dysphoric or depressed mood insomnia irritability frustration or anger anxiety difficulty concen- trating restlessness or impatience decreased heart rate and increased appetite or weight gain the withdrawal symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterioncthe symptoms must not be due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder criterion d
these symptoms are in large part due to nicotine deprivation and are typically more intense among individuals who smoke cigarettes than among individuals who use other nicotine-containing products the more rapid onset of nicotine effects with cigarette smoking leads to a more intensive habit pattern that is more difficult to give up because of the frequency and rapidity of reinforcement and the greater physical dependence on nicotine in individuals who smoke cigarettes heart rate decreases by 5 to 12 beats per minute in the first few days after stopping smoking and weight increases an average of 2-3 kg over the first year after stopping smoking mild symptoms of withdrawal may occur after switching to low-tar/nicotine cigarettes and after stopping the use of smokeless chewing tobacco nicotine gum or nicotine patches
diagnostic criteria for 2920 nicotine withdrawal
a daily use of nicotine for at least several weeks

associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders craving is an important element in nicotine withdrawal and may account for the difficulty that individuals have in giving up nicotine-containing products other symptoms associated with nicotine withdrawal include a desire for sweets and impaired performance on tasks requiring vigilance several features associated with nicotine dependence appear to predict a greater level of difficulty in stopping nicotine use smoking soon after waking smoking when ill difficulty refraining from smoking reporting the first cigarette of the day to be the one most difficult to give up and smoking more in the morning than in the afternoon the number of cigarettes smoked per day the nicotine yield of the cigarette and the number of pack-years also are related to the likelihood of an individual stopping smoking nicotine dependence is more common among individuals with other mental disorders depending on the population studied from 55% to 90% of individuals with other mental disorders smoke compared to 30% in the general population mood anxiety and other substance-related disorders may be more common in individuals who smoke than in those who are ex-smokers and those who have never smoked
associated laboratory findings withdrawalsymptoms are associated with a slow- ing on eegdecreases in catecholamine and cortisol levels rapid eye movement rem changes impairment on neuropsychological testing and decreased metabolic rate smoking increases the metabolism of many medications prescribed for the treatmentof mental disorders and of other substances thus cessation of smoking can increase the blood levels of these medications and other substances sometimes to a clinically significant degree this effect does not appear to be due to nicotine but rather to other compounds in tobacco nicotine and its metabolite cotinine can be measured in blood saliva or urine persons who smoke also often have diminished pulmonary function tests and increased mean corpuscularvolume mcv
246 substance-related disorders
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
nicotine withdrawal may be associated with a dry or productive cough decreased heart rate increased appetite or weight gain and a dampened orthostatic response the most common signs of nicotine dependence are tobacco odor cough evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and excessive skin wrinkling tobacco stains on the fingers can occur but are rare tobacco use can markedly increase the risk of lung oral and other cancers cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions chronic obstructive and other lung diseases ulcers maternal and fetal complications and other conditions although most of these problems appear to be caused by the carcinogens and carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke rather than by nicotine itself nicotine may increase the risk for cardiovascular events those who have never smoked but are chronically exposed to tobacco smoke appear to be at increased risk for conditions such as lung cancer and heart disease
specific culture age and gender features
the prevalence of smoking is decreasing in most industrialized nations but is increasing in the developing areas in the united states the prevalence of smoking is slightly higher in males than in females however the prevalence of smoking is decreasing more rapidly in males than in females in other countries smoking is often much more prevalent among males
prevalence
in the united states approximately 45% of the general population have never smoked the remainder fall into one or more of the following categories 25% are ex-smokers 30% currently smoke cigarettes 4% use pipes or cigars and 3% use smokeless tobacco in the united states the prevalence of smoking has been decreasing approximately 07%-10% per year the lifetime prevalence of nicotine dependence in the general population is estimated to be 20%in the united states between 50% and 80% of individuals who currently smoke have nicotine dependence lifetime prevalence of nicotine withdrawal among persons who smoke appears to be about 50%prospectively it is estimated that about 50% of those who quit smoking on their own and about 75% of those in treatment programs experience nicotine withdrawalwhen they stop smoking
course
smokingusuallybegins inthe earlyteens how quicklydependence develops isunclear among those who continue to smoke through age 20 years 95% become regular daily smokers of those who successfully quit less than 25% quit on their first attempt most individuals who smoke have 3-4 failures before they stop smoking for good in the united states about 45% of those who have ever smoked eventually stop smoking withdrawal symptoms can begin within a few hours of cessation typically peak in 1-4 days and last for 3-4 weeks depressive symptoms postcessation may be associated with a relapse to smoking whether other nicotine withdrawal symptoms play a major role in relapse to smoking is debatable increased hunger and weight gain often persist for at least 6 months six months postcessation 50% of individuals who have quit smoking report having had a desire for a cigarette in the last 24 hours
familial pattern
the risk for smoking increases threefold if a first-degree biological relative smokes twin and adoption studies indicate that genetic factors contribute to the onset and continuation of smoking with the degree of heritability equivalent to that observed with alcohol dependence
differential diagnosis
for a general discussion of the differential diagnosis of substance-related disorders see p 190
the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal overlap with those of other substance withdrawal syndromes caffeine intoxication anxiety mood and sleep disor- ders and m edication-induced akathisia admission to smoke-free inpatient units can induce withdrawal symptoms that might mimic intensify or disguise other diagnoses reduction of symptoms associated with the resumption of smoking or nicotine- replacement therapy confirms the diagnosis
because regular nicotine use does not appear to impair mental functioning nicotine dependence is not readily confused with other substance-related disorders and mental disorders
2929 nicotine-related disorder not otherwise specified
the nicotine-related disorder not otherwise specified category is for disorders associated with the use of nicotine that are not classifiable as nicotine dependence or nicotine withdrawal
opioid-related disorders
the opioids include natural opioidsmorphine semisyntheticsheroin and synthetics with morphine-like actioncodeine hydromorphone methadone oxycodone meperidine fentanyl medications such as pentazocine and buprenorphine that have both opiate agonist and antagonist effects are also included in this class because their agonist properties produce similar physiological and behavioral effects opioids are prescribed as analgesics anesthetics antidiarrheal agents or cough suppressants heroin is one of the most commonly abused drugs of this class and is usually taken by injection although it can be smoked or snorted when very pure heroin is available fentanyl is injected whereas cough suppressants and antidiarrheal agents are taken orally the other opioids are taken both by injection and orally

29289 opioid intoxication
also refer to the text and criteria for substance intoxication see p 183 the essential feature of opioid intoxication is the presence of clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changesinitial euphoria followed by apathy dys- phoria psychomotor agitation or retardation impaired judgment or impaired social or occupational functioning that develop during or shortly after opioid use criteria a and b intoxication is accompanied by pupillary constriction unless there has been a severe overdose with consequent anoxia and pupillary dilation and one or more of the following signs drowsiness described as being on the nod or even coma slurred speech and impairment in attention or memory criterion c individuals with opioid intoxication may demonstrate inattention to the environment even to the point of ignoring potentially harmful events the symptoms must not be due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder criterion d
the magnitude of the behavioral and physiological changes that result from opioid use depends on the dose as well as characteristics of the individual using the substancetolerance rate of absorption chronicity of use symptoms of opioid intoxication usually last for several hours a time frame that is consistent with the half-life of most opioid drugs severe intoxication following an opioid overdose can lead to coma respiratory depression pupillary dilation unconsciousness and even death

2920 opioid withdrawal
also refer to the text and criteria for substance withdrawal see p 184 the essential feature of opioid withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the cessation of or reduction in opioid use that has been heavy and prolonged criterion al the withdrawal syndrome can be also precipitated by administration of an opioid antagonistnaloxone or naltrexone after a period of opioid use criterion a2 opioid withdrawal is characterized by a pattern of signs and symptoms that are opposite to the acute agonist effects the first of these are subjective and consist of complaints of anxiety restlessness and an achy feeling that is often located in the back and legs accompanied by a wish to obtain opioids craving and
drug-seeking behavior along with irritability and increased sensitivity to pain three or more of the following must be present to make a diagnosis of opioid withdrawal dysphoric mood nausea or vomiting muscle aches lacrimation or rhinorrhea pupillary dilation piloerection or increased sweating diarrhea yawning fever and insomnia criterion b piloerection and fever are associated with severe withdrawal and are not often seen in routine clinical practice because individuals with opioid dependence usually obtain substances before withdrawal becomes that far advanced these symp- toms of opioid withdrawal must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion c the symptoms must not be due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder criterion d
in most individuals who are dependent on short-acting drugs such as heroin withdrawal symptoms occur within 6-24 hours after the last dose symptoms may take 2-4 days to emerge in the case of longer-acting drugs such as methadone or laam l-alphacetylmethadol acute withdrawal symptoms for a short-acting opioid such as heroin usually peak within 1-3 days and gradually subside over a period of 5-7 days less acute withdrawal symptoms can last for weeks to months these more chronic symptoms include anxiety dysphoria anhedonia insomnia and drug craving

associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders opioid dependence is commonly associated with a history of drug-related crimespossession or distribu- tion of drugs forgery burglary robbery larceny or receiving stolen goods among health care professionals and individuals who have ready access to controlled sub- stances there is often a different pattern of illegal activitiesinvolving problems with state licensing boards professional staffs of hospitals or other administrative agencies divorce unemployment or irregular employment are often associated with opioid dependence at all socioeconomic levels
for many individuals the effect of taking an opioid for the first time is dysphoric rather than euphoric and nausea and vomiting may result individuals with opioid dependence are especially at risk for the development of brief depressive symptoms and for episodes of mild to moderate depression that meet symptomatic and duration criteria for major depressive disorder these symptoms may represent an opioid- induced mood disorder see p 370 or exacerbations of a preexisting primary depressive disorder periods of depression are especially common during chronic intoxication or in association with psychosocial stressors that are related to the opioid dependence insomnia is common especially during withdrawal antisocial personality disorder is much more common in individuals with opioid dependence than in the general population posttraumatic stress disorder is also seen with increased frequency a history of conduct disorder in childhood or adolescence has been identified as a significant risk factor for substance-related disorders especially opioid dependence
associated laboratory findings routine urine toxicology tests are often positive for opioid drugs in individuals with opioid dependence urine tests remain positive for most opioids for 12-36 hours after administration longer-acting opioidsmethadone and laam can be identified in urine for several days fentanyl is not detected by standard urine tests but can be identified by more specialized procedures laboratory evidence of the presence of other substancescocaine marijuana alcohol amphetamines benzodiazepines is common hepatitis screening tests are often positive either for hepatitis antigen signifying active infection or hepatitis antibody
signifying past infection mildly elevated liver function tests are common either as a result of resolving hepatitis or from toxic injury to the liver due to contaminants that have been mixed with the injected opioid subtle changes in cortisol secretion patterns and body temperature regulation have been observed for up to 6 months following opioid detoxification
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
acute and chronic opioid use are associated with a lack of secretions causing dry mouth and nose slowing of gastrointestinal activity and constipation visual acuity may be impaired as a result of pupillary constriction in individuals who use opioids intrave- nously sclerosed veins tracks and puncture marks on the lower portions of the upper extremities are common veins sometimes become so badly sclerosed that peripheral edema develops and individuals switch to veins in the legs neck or groin when these veins become unusable or otherwise unavailable individuals often inject directly into their subcutaneous tissue skin-popping resulting in cellulitis abscesses and circu- lar-appearing scars from healed skin lesions tetanus is a relatively rare but extremely serious consequence of injecting opioids infections may also occur in other organs and include bacterial endocarditis hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection tuberculosis is a particularly serious problem among individuals who use drugs intravenously especially those dependent on heroin infection with the tubercle bacillus is usually asymptomatic and evident only by the presence of a positive tuberculin skin test however many cases of active tuberculosis have been found especially among those who are infected with hiv these individuals often have a newly acquired infection but also are likely to experience reactivation of a prior infection due to impaired immune function persons who sniff heroin or other opioids snorting often develop irritation of the nasal mucosa sometimes accompanied by perforation of the nasal septum difficulties in sexual functioning are common males often experience erectile dysfunction during intoxication or chronic use females commonly have disturbances of reproductive function and irregular menses
the incidence ofhivinfectionishigh among individualswho use intravenousdrugs a large proportion of whom are individuals with opioid dependence hiv infection rates have been reported to be as high as 60% among persons dependent on heroin in some areas of the united states
in addition to infections such as cellulitis hepatitis hiv tuberculosis and endocar- ditis opioid dependence is associated with a very high death rateâ€”at the level of approximately 10 per 1000 per year among untreated persons death most often results from overdose accidents injuries or other general medical complications accidents and injuries due to violence that is associated with buying or selling drugs are common in some areas violence accounts for more opioid-related deaths than overdose or hiv infection physiological dependence on opioids may occur in about half of the infants born to females with opioid dependence this can produce a severe withdrawal syndrome requiring medical treatment although low birth weight is also seen in children of mothers with opioid dependence it is usually not marked and is generally not associated with serious adverse consequences
specific culture age and gender featuressince the 1920s in the united states members of minority groups living in economically deprived areas have been overrepresented among persons with opioid dependenceopioid-related disorders 253
254 substance-related disorders
however in the late 1800s and early 1900s opioid dependence was seen more often among white middle-class individuals suggesting that differences in use reflect the availability of opioid drugs and other social factors medical personnel who have ready access to opioids may have an increased risk for opioid abuse and dependence
increasing age appears to be associated with a decrease in prevalence this tendency for dependence to remit generally begins after age 40 years and has been called maturing out however many persons have remained opioid dependent for 50 years or longer males are more commonly affected with the male-to-female ratio typically being 3 or 41
prevalence
a community survey conducted in the united states in 1991 reported that 6% of the population sampled ever used analgesics for nonmedical purposes 25%had used them within the past year and 07% has used them in the last month the survey also showed that 13% had used heroin in their lifetime and 02% had used it in the last year use in the last month was not reported because the survey assessed patterns of use rather than diagnoses it is not known how many of those who used analgesics or heroin had symptoms that met criteria for dependence or abuse a community study conducted in the united states from 1980 to 1985 that used the more narrowly defined dsm-iii criteria found that 07% of the adult population had opioid dependence or abuse at some time in their lives among those with dependence or abuse 18%reported use in the last month and 42% reported having had a problem with opioids in the last year
course
opioid dependence can begin at any age but problems associated with opioid use are most commonly first observed in the late teens or early 20s once dependence develops it is usually continuous over a period of many years even though brief periods of abstinence are frequent relapse following abstinence is common even after many years of incarceration one exception to the typical chronic course of opioid dependence was observed in service personnel who became dependent on opioids in vietnam on their return to the united states less than 10% of those who had been dependent on opioids relapsed although they experienced increased rates of alcohol or amphetamine dependence few data are available on the course of opioid abuse
familial pattern
the family members of individuals with opioid dependence are likely to have higher levels of psychopathology especially an increased incidence of other substance-related disorders and antisocial personality disorder
differential diagnosis
for a general discussion of the differential diagnosis of substance-related disorders see p 190 opioid-induced disorders may be characterized by symptomsdepressed mood that resemble primary mental disordersdysthymia versus opioid- induced mood disorder with depressive features with onset during intoxication
phencyclidine-related disorders 255
see p 193 for a discussion of this differential diagnosis opioids are less likely to produce symptoms of mental disturbance than are most other drugs of abuse a n d  in some instances will even reduce such symptoms in these cases mental symptoms or disorders may emerge after opioid use is discontinued
a lcohol intoxication and sedative h ypnotic or a nxiolytic intoxication can cause a clinical picture that resembles opioid intoxication a diagnosis of alcohol or sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication can usually be made based on the absence of pupillary constriction or the lack of a response to a naloxone challenge in some cases intoxication may be due both to opioids and to alcohol or other sedatives in these cases the naloxone challenge will not reverse all of the sedative effects the anxiety and restlessness associated with opioid withdrawal resemble symptoms seen in sedativehypnoticor anxiolytic withdrawalhowever opioid withdrawalis also accompanied by rhinorrhea lacrimation and pupillary dilation which are not seen in sedative-type withdrawal dilated pupils are also seen in hallucinogen intoxica- tion amphetamine intoxication and cocaine intoxication however others signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal such as nausea vomiting diarrhea abdominal cramps rhinorrhea or lacrimation are not present opioid intoxication and opioid withdrawal are distinguished from the other opioid-induceddisordersopioid- induced mood disorder with onset during intoxication because the symptoms in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with opioid intoxication or opioid withdrawal and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention

phencyclidine
or phencfclidine-likej-related disorders
the phencyclidines or phencyclidine-like substances include phencyclidine pcp sernylan and similarly acting compounds such as ketamine ketalar ketaject and the thiophene analogue of phencyclidine tcp l-[l-2-thienyl-cyclohexyl]piperidine these substances were first developed as dissociative anesthetics in the 1950s and became street drugs in the 1960s they can be taken orally or intravenously or can be smoked phencyclidine sold illicitly under a variety of names such as pcp hogtranq angel dust and peace pill is the most commonly abused substance in this class

associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders although individuals with phencyclidine intoxication may remain alert and oriented they may show delirium coma psychotic symptoms or catatonic mutism with posturing repeated intoxications may lead to job family social or legal problems violence agitation and bizarre behaviorconfused wandering may occur individuals with phencyclidine depen- dence or abuse may report repeated intoxication-induced hospitalizations emergency- room visits and arrests for confused or bizarre behavior or for fighting conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial personality disorder in adults may be associated with phencyclidine usedependence on other substances especially cocaine alcohol and amphetamines is common among those who have phencyclidine dependence
associated laboratory findings phencyclidine or a related substance is present in the urine of individuals who are acutely intoxicated with one of these substances the substance may be detectable in urine for several weeks after the end of prolonged or very high dose use phencyclidine may be detected more readily in acidic urine creatine phosphokinase cpk and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase scot are often elevated
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
phencyclidine intoxication produces extensive cardiovascular and neurologicalseizures dystonias dyskinesias catalepsy and hypothermia or hyperthermia toxicity in those with phencyclidine dependence or abuse there may be physical evidence of injuries from accidents fights and falls needle tracks hepatitis human immunodefici- ency virus hivdisease and bacterial endocarditis may be found among the relatively few individualswho take phencyclidine intravenously drowning even in small volumes of water has been reported respiratory problems arise with apnea bronchospasm bronchorrhea aspiration during coma and hypersalivation rhabdomyolysis with renal impairment is seen in about 2% of individuals who seek emergency care cardiac arrest is a rare outcome
260 substance-related disorders
specific culture age and gender features
the prevalence of phencyclidine-related problems appears to be higher among males about twofold among those between ages 20 and 40 years and among ethnic minorities about twofold males compose about three-quarters of those with phen- cyclidine-related emergency-room visits
prevalence
medical examiners nationally report that phencyclidine is involved in about 3% of deaths associated with substance use it is mentioned as a problem in about 3% of substance- related emergency-room visits the percentage of high-school seniors who report ever having used phencyclidine fell from about 13% in 1980 to about 3% in1990

and nausea sometimes accompanied by vomiting and psychomotor agitation a grand mal seizure may occur in perhaps as many as 20%-30% of individuals undergoing untreated withdrawal from these substances in severe withdrawal visual tactile or auditory hallucinations or illusions can occur if the person's reality testing is intact ie he or she knows the substance is causing the hallucinations and the illusions occur in a clear sensorium the specifier with perceptual disturbances can be noted see below the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion c the symptoms must not be due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another mental disorderalcohol withdrawal or generalized anxiety disorder criterion d relief of withdrawal symptoms with administration of any sedative-hypnotic agent would support a diagnosis of sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal
the withdrawal syndrome is characterized by signs and symptoms that are generally the opposite of the acute effects that are likely to be observed in a first-time user of these agents the time course of the withdrawal syndrome is generally predicted by the half-life of the substance medications whose actions typically last about 10 hours or lesslorazepam oxazepam and temazepam produce withdrawal symptoms within 6-8 hours of decreasing blood levels that peak in intensity on the second day and improve markedly by the fourth or fifth day for substances with longer half-livesdiazepam symptoms may not develop for more than a week peak in intensity during the second week and decrease markedly during the third or fourth week there may be additional longer-term symptoms at a much lower level of intensity that persist for several months as with alcohol these lingering withdrawal symptomsanxiety moodiness and trouble sleeping can be mistaken for non-substance-induced anxiety or depressive disordersgeneralized anxiety disorder
the longer the substance has been taken and the higher the dosages used the more likely it is that there will be severe withdrawal however withdrawal has been reported with as little as 15 mg of diazepam or its equivalent in other benzodiazepines when taken daily for several months dosages of approximately 40 mg of diazepam or its equivalent daily are more likely to produce clinically relevant withdrawal symptoms and even higher doses100 mg of diazepam are more likely to be followed by withdrawal seizures or delirium sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal delirium see p 129 is characterized by disturbances in consciousness and cognition withvisual tactile or auditory hallucinations when present sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal deliriumshould be diagnosed instead ofwithdrawal

associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic dependence and abuse may often be associated with dependence on or abuse of other substancesalcohol cannabis cocaine heroin amphetamines sedatives are often used to alleviate the unwanted effects of these other substances acute intoxication can result in accidental injury through falls and automobile accidents for elderly individuals even short-term use of these sedating medications at prescribed doses can be associated with an increased risk for cognitive problems and falls some data indicate that the disinhibiting effects of these agents can like alcohol actually contribute to overly aggressive behavior with subsequent interpersonal and legal problems intense or repeated sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication may be associated with severe depressions that although temporary can be intense enough to lead to suicide attempts and completed suicides accidental or deliberate overdoses similar to those observed for alcohol abuse or dependence or repeated alcohol intoxication can occur in contrast to their wide margin of safety when used alone benzodiazepines taken in combination with alcohol appear to be particularly dangerous and accidental overdoses have been reported accidental overdoses have also been reported in individuals who deliberately abuse barbiturates and other nonbenzodiaze- pine sedativesmethaqualone with repeated use in search of euphoria tolerance develops to the sedative effects and a progressively higher dose is used however tolerance to brain stem depressant effects develops much more slowly and as the person takes more substance to achieve euphoria there may be a sudden onset of respiratory depression and hypotension which may result in death antisocial behavior and antisocial personality disorder are associated with sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic dependence and abuse especially when the substances are obtained illegally
associated laboratory findings almost all of these substances can be identified through laboratory evaluations of urine or blood which can quantify the amounts of these agents in the body urine tests are likely to remain positive for up to a week or so after the use of long-acting substancesflurazepam
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
physical examination is likely to reveal evidence of a mild decrease in most aspects of autonomic nervous system functioning including a slower pulse a slightly decreased respiratory rate and a slight drop in blood pressure most likely to occur with postural changes overdoses of sedatives hypnotics and anxiolytics may be associated with a deterioration in vital signs that may signal an impending medical emergencyrespiratoryarrestfrombarbituratestheremaybeconsequences oftraumaeginternal bleeding or a subdural hematoma from accidents that occur while intoxicated intravenous use of these substances can result in medical complications related to the use of contaminated needleshepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus [hiv] infection
268 substance-related disorders
specific culture age and gender features
there are marked variations in prescription patterns and availability of this class of substances in different countries which may lead to variations in prevalence of sedative- hypnotic- or anxiolytic-related disorders deliberate intoxication to achieve a high is most likely to be observed in teenagers and individuals in their 20s withdrawal dependence and abuse are also seen in individuals in their 40s and older who escalate the dose of prescribed medications both acute and chronic toxic effects of these substances especially effects on cognition memory and motor coordination are likely to increase with age as a consequence of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic age-related changes individuals with dementia are more likely to develop intoxication and impaired physiological functioning at lower doses women may be at higher risk for prescription drug abuse of substances of this class
prevalence
in the united states up to 90% of individuals hospitalized for medical care or surgery receive orders for sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic medications during their hospital stay and more than 15%of american adults use these medications usually by prescription during any 1 year most of these individuals take the medication as directed without evidence of misuse among the medications in this class the benzodiazepines are the most widely used with perhaps 10% of adults having taken a benzodiazepine for at least 1 month during the prior year a community survey conducted in the united states in 1991 reported that about 4% of the population sampled had ever used sedatives for nonmedical purposes approximately 1% had such use in the last year and 04% in the last month for antianxiety agents around 6% of the population had ever used them for nonmedical purposes almost 2% had such use in the last year and 05% in the last month because the survey assessed patterns of use rather than diagnoses it is not known how many of those who used substances from this class had symptoms that met criteria for dependence or abuse a community study conducted in the united states from 1980 to 1985 that used the more narrowly defined dsm-iii criteria found that 11% of the population surveyed had met criteria for sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic abuse or dependence at some time in their lives
course
the more usual course involves young people in their teens or 20s who may escalate their recreational use of sedatives hypnotics and anxiolytics to the point at which they develop problems that might qualify for a diagnosis of dependence or abuse this pattern may be especially likely among individuals who have other substance use disordersrelated to alcohol opioids cocaine amphetamine an initial pattern of intermittent use at parties can lead to daily use and high levels of tolerance once this occurs an increasing level of interpersonal work and legal difficulties as well as increasingly severe episodes of memory impairment and physiological withdrawal can be expected to ensue
the second and less frequently observed clinical course begins with an individual who originally obtained the medication by prescription from a physician usually for the treatment of anxiety insomnia or somatic complaints although the great majority of those who are prescribed a medication from this class do not develop problems a small
sedative- hypnotic- or anxiolytic-related disorders 269
proportion do in these individuals as either tolerance or a need for higher doses of the medication develops there is a gradual increase in the dose and frequency of self-administration the person is likely to continue to justify use on the basis of the original symptoms of anxiety or insomnia but substance-seeking behavior becomes more prominent and the person may seek out multiple physicians to obtain sufficient supplies of the medication tolerance can reach high levels and withdrawal including seizures and withdrawal delirium may occur other individuals at heightened risk might include those with alcohol dependence who may receive repeated prescriptions in response to their complaints of alcohol-related anxiety or insomnia
differential diagnosis
for a general discussion of the differential diagnosis of substance-related disorders see p 190 sedative- hypnotic- or anxiolytic-induced disorders may present with symp- tomsanxiety that resemble primarymental disordersgeneralized anxiety disorder versus sedative- hypnotic- or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder with onset during withdrawal see p 193 for a discussion of this differential diagnosis
sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication closely resembles alcohol intoxica- tion except for the smell of alcohol on the breath in older persons the clinical picture of intoxication can resemble a progressive dementia in addition the slurred speech incoordination and other associated features characteristic of sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication could be the result of a general medical conditionmultiple sclerosis or of a prior head traumaa subdural hematoma
alcohol withdrawal produces a syndrome very similar to that of sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal the anxiety insomnia and autonomic nervous system hyperactivity that is a consequence of intoxication with other drugsstimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine that are consequences of physiological conditionshyperthyroidism or that are related to primary anxiety disorderspanic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder can resemble some aspects of sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal
sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication and withdrawal are distinguished from the other sedative- hypnotic- or anxiolytic-induced disordersseda- tive- hypnotic- or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder with onset during with- drawal because the symptoms in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication or withdrawal and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention
it should be noted that there are individuals who continue to take benzodiazepine medication according to a physician's direction for a legitimate medical indication over extended periods of time even if physiologically dependent on the medication many of these individuals do not develop symptoms that meet the criteria for dependence because they are not preoccupied with obtaining the substance and its use does not interfere with their performance of usual social or occupational roles

other or unknown substance-related disorders
the other or unknown substanceâ€”related disorders category is for classifying substance-related disorders associated with substances not listed above examples of these substances which are described in more detail below include anabolic steroids nitrite inhalants poppers nitrous oxide over-the-counter and prescription medica- tions not otherwise covered by the 11 categoriescortisol antihistamines benztro- pine and other substances that have psychoactive effects in addition this category may be used when the specific substance is unknownan intoxication after taking a bottle of unlabeled pills
anabolic steroids sometimes produce an initial sense of enhanced well-being or even euphoria which is replaced after repeated use by lack of energy irritability and other forms of dysphoria continued use of these substances may lead to more severe symptomsdepressive symptomatology and general medical conditions liver disease
nitrite inhalants poppersâ€”forms of amyl butyl and isobutyl nitrite produce an intoxication that is characterized by a feeling of fullness in the head mild euphoria a change in the perception of time relaxation of smooth muscles and a possible increase in sexual feelings in addition to possible compulsive use these substances carry dangers of potential impairment of immune functioning irritation of the respiratory system a decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and a toxic reaction that can include vomiting severe headache hypotension and dizziness
other or unknown substance-related disorders 271
nitrous oxide laughing gas causes rapid onset of an intoxication that is characterized by light-headedness and a floating sensation that clears in a matter of minutes after administration is stopped there are reports of temporary but clinically relevant confusion and reversible paranoid states when nitrous oxide is used regularly
other substances that are capable of producing mild intoxications include catnip which can produce states similar to those observed with marijuana and which in high doses is reported to result in lsd-typeperceptions betel nut which is chewed in many cultures to produce a mild euphoria and floating sensation and kava a substance derived from the south pacific pepper plant which produces sedation incoordination weight loss mild forms of hepatitis and lung abnormalities in addition individuals can develop dependence and impairment through repeated self-administration of over-the- counter and prescription drugs including cortisol antiparkinsonian agents that have anticholinergic properties and antihistamines a discussion of how to code medication-related disorders is found on p 188

schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
the disorders included in this section are all characterized by having psychotic symptoms as the defining feature other disorders that may present with psychotic symptoms but not as defining features are included elsewhere in the manual eg
dementia of the alzheimer's type and substance-induced delirium in the delirium dementia and amnestic and other cognitive disorders section major depressive disorder with psychotic features in the mood disorders section
the term psychotic has historically received a number of different definitions none of which has achieved universal acceptance the narrowest definition of psychotic is restricted to delusions or prominent hallucinations with the hallucinations occurring in the absence of insight into their pathological nature a slightly less restrictive definition would also include prominent hallucinations that the individual realizes are hallucinatory experiences broader still is a definition that also includes other positive symptoms of schizophrenia ie disorganized speech grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior unlike these definitions based on symptoms the definition used in earlier classificationsdsm-ii and icd-9 was probably far too inclusive and focused on the severity of functional impairment so that a mental disorder was termed psychotic if it resulted in impairment that grossly interferes with the capacity to meet ordinary demands of life finally the term has been defined conceptually as a loss of ego boundaries or a gross impairment in reality testing the different disorders in this section emphasize different aspects of the various definitions of psychotic in schizophrenia schizophreniform disorder schizoaffective disorder and brief psychotic disorder the term psychotic refers to delusions any prominent hallucinations disorganized speech or disorganized or catatonic behavior in psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition and in substance-induced psychotic disorder psychotic refers to delusions or only those hallucinations that are not accompanied by insight finally in delusional disorder and shared psychotic disorder psychotic is equivalent to delusional
the following disorders are included in this section
schizophrenia is a disturbance that lasts for at least 6 months and includes at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms ie two [or more] of the following delusions hallucinations disorganized speech grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior negative symptoms definitions for the schizophrenia subtypes paranoid disorganized cata- tonic undifferentiated and residual are also included in this sectionschizophreniform disorder is characterized by a symptomatic presentation that 273
274 schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
is equivalent to schizophrenia except for its duration ie the disturbance lasts from 1 to 6 months and the absence of a requirement that there be a decline in functioning schizoaffective disorder is a disturbance in which a mood episode and the
active-phase symptoms of schizophrenia occur together and were preceded or are followed by at least 2 weeks of delusions or hallucinations without prominent mood symptoms
delusional disorder is characterized by at least 1 month of nonbizarre delusions without other active-phase symptoms of schizophrenia
brief psychotic disorder is a psychotic disturbance that lasts more than 1 day and remits by 1 month
shared psychotic disorder is a disturbance that develops in an individual who is influenced by someone else who has an established delusion with similar content
in psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition the psychotic symptoms are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition
in substance-induced psychotic disorder the psychotic symptoms are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a drug of abuse a medication or toxin exposure
psychotic disorder not otherwise specified is included for classifying psychotic presentations that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific psychotic disorders defined in this section or psychotic symptomatology about which there is inadequate or contradictory information
schizophrenia
the essential features of schizophrenia are a mixture of characteristic signs and symptoms both positive and negative that have been present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period or for a shorter time if successfully treated with some signs of the disorder persisting for at least 6 months criteria a and c these signs and symptoms are associated with marked social or occupational dysfunction criterion b the disturbance is not better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder or a mood disorder with psychotic features and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition criteriad and e in individualswith a previous diagnosis of autistic disorder or another pervasive developmental disorder the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is warranted only if prominent delusions or hallucinations are present for at least a month criterion f the characteristicsymptoms of schizophrenia involve a range of cognitive and emotional dysfunctions that include perception inferential thinking language and communication behavioral monitoring affect fluency and productivity of thought and speech hedonic capacity volition and drive and attention no single symptom is pathognomonic of schizophrenia the diagnosis involves the recognition of a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with impaired occupational or social functioning
characteristic symptoms criterion a may be conceptualized as falling into two broad categoriesâ€”positive and negative the positive symptoms appear to reflect an excess or distortion of normal functions whereas the negative symptoms appear to reflect a diminution or loss of normal functions the positive symptoms criteria a1-a4 include distortions or exaggerations of inferential thinking delusions perception
hallucinations language and communication disorganized speech and behavioral monitoring grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior these positive symptoms may comprise two distinct dimensions which may in turn be related to different underlying neural mechanisms and clinical correlations the psychotic dimension includes delu- sions and hallucinations whereas the disorganization dimension includes disorga- nized speech and behavior negative symptoms criterion a5 include restrictions in the range and intensity of emotional expression affective flattening in the fluency and productivity of thought and speech alogia and in the initiation of goal-directed behavior avolition
delusions criterion al are erroneous beliefs that usually involve a misinterpreta- tion of perceptions or experiences their content may include a variety of themespersecutory referential somatic religious or grandiose persecutory delusions are most common the person believes he or she is being tormented followed tricked spied on or subjected to ridicule referential delusions are also common the person believes that certain gestures comments passages from books newspapers song lyrics or other environmental cues are specifically directed at him or her the distinction between a delusion and a strongly held idea is sometimes difficult to make and depends on the degree of conviction with which the belief is held despite clear contradictory evidence
although bizarre delusions are considered to be especially characteristic of schizo- phrenia bizarreness may be difficult to judge especially across different cultures delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible and not understandable and do not derive from ordinary life experiences an example of a bizarre delusion is a person's belief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and has replaced them with someone else's organs without leaving any wounds or scars an example of a nonbizarre delusion is a person's false belief that he or she is under surveillance by the police delusions that express a loss of control over mind or body ie those included among schneider's list of first-rank symptoms are generally considered to be bizarre these include a person's belief that his or her thoughts have been taken away by some outside force thought withdrawal that alien thoughts have been put into his or her mind thought insertion or that his or her body or actions are being acted on or manipulated by some outside force delusions of control if the delusions are judged to be bizarre only this single symptom is needed to satisfy criterion a for schizophrenia
hallucinations criterion a2 may occur in any sensory modalityauditory visual olfactory gustatory and tactile but auditory hallucinations are by far the most common and characteristic of schizophrenia auditory hallucinations are usually expe- rienced as voices whether familiar or unfamiliar that are perceived as distinct from the person's own thoughts the content may be quite variable although pejorative or threatening voices are especially common certain types of auditory hallucinations ie two or more voices conversing with one another or voices maintaining a running commentary on the person's thoughts or behavior have been considered to be particularly characteristic of schizophrenia and were included among schneider's list of first-rank symptoms if these types of hallucinations are present then only this single symptom is needed to satisfy criterion a the hallucinations must occur in the context of a clear sensorium those that occur while falling asleep hypnagogic or waking up hypnopompic are considered to be within the range of normal experience isolated experiences of hearing one's name called or experiences that lack the quality of an external percepta humming in one's head are also not considered to be hallucinations characteristic of schizophrenia hallucinations may also be a normal part of religious experience in certain cultural contextsschizophrenia 275
276 schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
disorganized thinking formal thought disorder loosening of associations has been argued by some bleuler in particular to be the single most important feature of schizophrenia because of the difficulty inherent in developing an objective definition of thought disorder and because in a clinical setting inferences about thought are based primarily on the individual's speech the concept of disorganized speech criterion a3 has been emphasized in the definition for schizophrenia used in this manual the speech of individuals with schizophrenia may be disorganized in a variety of ways the person may slip off the track from one topic to another derailment or loose associations answers to questions may be obliquely related or completely unrelated tangentiality and rarely speech may be so severely disorganized that it is nearly incomprehensible and resembles receptive aphasia in its linguistic disorganization incoherence or word salad because mildly disorganized speech is common and nonspecific the symptom must be severe enough to substantially impair effective communication less severe disorganized thinking or speech may occur during the prodromal and residual periods of schizophrenia see criterionc
grossly disorganized behavior criterion a4 may manifest itself in a variety of ways ranging from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation problems may be noted in any form of goal-directed behavior leading to difficulties in performing activities of daily living such as organizing meals or maintaining hygiene the person may appear markedly disheveled may dress in an unusual mannerwearing multiple overcoats scarves and gloves on a hot day or may display clearly inappropriate sexual behaviorpublic masturbation or unpredictable and untriggered agitationshouting or swearing care should be taken not to apply this criterion too broadly grossly disorganized behavior must be distinguished from behavior that is merely aimless or generally unpurposeful and from organized behavior that is motivated by delusional beliefs similarly a few instances of restless angry or agitated behavior should not be considered to be evidence of schizophrenia especially if the motivation is understandable
catatonic motor behaviors criterion a4 include a marked decrease in reactivity to the environment sometimes reaching an extreme degree of complete unawareness catatonic stupor maintaining a rigid posture and resisting efforts to be moved catatonic rigidity active resistance to instructions or attempts to be moved catatonic negativism the assumption of inappropriate or bizarre postures catatonic posturing or purposeless and unstimulated excessive motor activity catatonic excitement although catatonia has historically been associated with schizophrenia the clinician should keep in mind that catatonic symptoms are nonspecific and may occur in other mental disorders see mood disorders with catatonic features p 382 in general medical conditions see catatonic disorder due to a general medical condition p 169 and medication-induced movement disorders see neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism p 736
the negative symptoms of schizophrenia criterion a5 account for a substantial degree of the morbidity associated with the disorder three negative symptomsâ€” affective flattening alogia and avolitionâ€”are included in the definition of schizophrenia other negative symptomsanhedonia are noted in the associated features and disorders section below affective flattening is especially common and is characterized by the person's face appearing immobile and unresponsive with poor eye contact and reduced body language although a person with affective flattening may smile and warm up occasionally his or her range of emotional expressiveness is clearly diminished most of the time it may be useful to observe the person interacting with peers to determine whether affective flattening is sufficiently persistent to meet the criterion alogia poverty of speech is manifested by brief laconic empty replies the individual with alogia
appears to have a diminution of thoughts that is reflected in decreased fluency and productivity of speech this must be differentiated from an unwillingness to speak a clinical judgment that may require observation over time and in a variety of situations avolition is characterized by an inability to initiate and persist in goal-directed activities the person may sit for long periods of time and show little interest in participating in work or social activities
although quite ubiquitous in schizophrenia negative symptoms are difficult to evaluate because they occur on a continuum with normality are nonspecific and may be due to a variety of other factorsas a consequence of positive symptoms medication side effects a mood disorder environmental understimulation or demoral- ization social isolation or impoverished speech may not be best conceived of as negative symptoms if they occur as a consequence of a positive symptoma paranoid delusion or a prominent hallucination for example the behavior of an individual who has the delusional belief that he will be in danger if he leaves his room or talks to anyone may mimic alogia and avolition neuroleptic medications often produce extrapyramidalside effects that closely resemble affective flatteningor avolition the distinction between true negative symptoms and medication side effects depends on clinical judgment concerning the severity of negative symptoms the nature and type of neuroleptic medication the effects of dosage adjustment and the effects of anticho- linergic medications the difficult distinction between negative symptoms and depressive symptoms may be informed by the other accompanying symptoms that are present and the fact that individuals with symptoms of depression typically experience an intense painful affect whereas those with schizophrenia have a diminution or emptiness of affect finally chronic environmental understimulation or demoralization may result in learned apathy and avolition in establishing the presence of negative symptoms perhaps the best test is their persistence for a considerable period of time despite efforts directed at resolving each of the potential causes described above it has been suggested that enduring negative symptoms be referred to as deficit symptoms
criterion a for schizophrenia requires that at least two of the five items be present concurrently for much of at least 1 month however if delusions are bizarre or hallucinations involve voices commenting or voices conversing then the presence of only one item is required the presence of this relatively severe constellation of signs and symptoms is referred to as the active phase in those situations in which the active-phase symptoms remit within a month in response to treatment criterion a can still be considered to have been met if the clinician judges that the symptoms would have persisted for a month in the absence of effective treatment in children evaluation of the characteristic symptoms should include due consideration of the presence of other disorders or developmental difficulties for example the disorganized speech in a child with a communication disorder should not count toward a diagnosis of schizophrenia unless the degree of disorganization is significantly greater than would be expected on the basis of the communication disorder alone
schizophrenia involves dysfunction in one or more major areas of functioninginterpersonal relations work or education or self-care criterion b typically func- tioning is clearly below that which had been achieved before the onset of symptoms if the disturbance begins in childhood or adolescence however there may be a failure to achieve what would have been expected for the individual rather than a deterioration in functioning comparing the individual with unaffected siblings may be helpful in making this determination educational progress is frequently disrupted and the individual may be unable to finish school many individuals are unable to hold a job forschizophrenia 277
278 schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
sustained periods of time and are employed at a lower level than their parents downward drift the majority 60%-70% of individuals with schizophrenia do not marry and most have relatively limited social contacts the dysfunction persists for a substantial period during the course of the disorder and does not appear to be a direct result of any single feature for example if a woman quits her job because of the circumscribed delusion that her boss is trying to kill her this alone is not sufficient evidence for this criterion unless there is a more pervasive pattern of difficulties usually in multiple domains of functioning
some signs of the disturbance must persist for a continuous period of at least 6 months criterion c during that time period there must be at least 1 month of symptoms or less than 1 month if symptoms are successfully treated that meet criterion a of schizophrenia the active phase prodromal symptoms are often present prior to the active phase and residual symptoms may follow it some prodromal and residual symptoms are relatively mild or subthreshold forms of the positive symptoms specified in criterion a individualsmay express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs that are not of delusional proportionsideas of reference or magical thinking they may have unusual perceptual experiencessensing the presence of an unseen person or force in the absence of formed hallucinations their speech may be generally understandable but digressive vague or overly abstract or concrete and their behavior may be peculiar but not grossly disorganizedmumbling to themselves collecting odd and apparently worthless objects in addition to these positive-like symptoms negative symptoms are particularly common in the prodromal and residual phases and can often be quite severe individuals who had been socially active may become withdrawn they lose interest in previously pleasurable activities they may become less talkative and inquisitive and they may spend the bulk of their time in bed such negative symptoms are often the first sign to the family that something is wrong family members may ultimately report that they experienced the individualas gradually slipping away
subtypes and course specifiers
the diagnosis of a particular subtype is based on the clinical picture that occasioned the most recent evaluation or admission to clinical care and may therefore change over time separate text and criteria are provided for each of the following subtypes

the following specifiers may be used to indicate the characteristic course of symptoms of schizophrenia over time these specifiers can be applied only after at least 1 year has elapsed since the initial onset of active-phase symptoms during this initial 1-year period no course specifiers can be given
episodic with interepisode residual symptoms this specifier applies when the course is characterized by episodes in which criterion a for schizophrenia is met and there are clinically significant residual symptoms between the episodes with prominent negative symptoms can be added if prominent negative symptoms are present during these residual periods
episodic with no interepisode residual symptoms this specifier applies when the course is characterized by episodes in which criterion a for schizo- phrenia is met and there are no clinically significant residual symptoms between the episodes
continuous this specifier applies when characteristic symptoms of criterion a are met throughout all or most of the course with prominent negative symptoms can be added if prominent negative symptoms are also present single episode in partial remission this specifier applies when there has been a single episode in which criterion a for schizophrenia is met and some clinically significant residual symptoms remain with prominent negative symptoms can be added ifthese residual symptoms include prominent negative symptoms
single episode in full remission this specifier applies when there has been a single episode in which criterion a for schizophrenia has been met and no clinically significant residual symptoms remain
other or unspecified pattern this specifier is used if another or an unspec- ified course pattern has been present
recording procedures
the diagnostic code for schizophrenia is selected based on the appropriate subtype 29530 for paranoid type 29510 for disorganized type 29520 for catatonic type 29590 for undifferentiated type and 29560 for residual type there are no fifth-digit codes available for the course specifiers in recording the name of the disorder the course specifiers are noted after the appropriate subtype29530 schizophrenia paranoid type episodic with interepisode residual symptoms with prominent nega- tive symptoms
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders the individual with schizophrenia may display inappropriate affectsmiling laughing or a silly facial expression in the absence of an appropriate stimulus which is one of the defining features of the disorganized type anhedonia is common and is manifested by a loss of interest or pleasure dysphoric mood may take the form of depression anxiety or anger there may be disturbances in sleep patternsleeping during the day and nighttime activity or restlessness the individual may show a lack of interest in eating or may refuse food as a consequence of delusional beliefs often there are abnormalities of psychomotor activitypacing rocking or apathetic immobility difficulty concentrating is frequently evident and may reflect problems with focusing attention or distractibility due to preoccupation with internal stimuli although basic intellectual functions are classically considered to be intact in schizophrenia some indications of cognitive dysfunction are often present the individual may be confused or disoriented or may have memory impairment during a period of exacerbation of active symptoms or in the presence of very severe negative symptoms lack of insight is common and may be one of the best predictors of poor outcome perhaps because it predisposes the individual to noncompliance with treatment depersonalization derealization and somatic concerns may occur and sometimes reach delusional proportions motor
schizophrenia 279
280 schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
abnormalitiesgrimacing posturing odd mannerisms ritualistic or stereotyped behavior are sometimes present the life expectancy of individuals with schizophrenia is shorter than that of the general population for a variety of reasons suicide is an important factor because approximately 10%of individualswith schizophrenia commit suicide risk factors for suicide include being male age under 30 years depressive symptoms unemployment and recent hospital discharge there is conflicting evidence with regard to whether the frequency of violent acts is greater than in the general population comorbidity with substance-related disorders including nicotine depen- dence is common schizotypal schizoid or paranoid personality disorder may some- times precede the onset of schizophrenia whether these personality disorders are simply prodromal to schizophrenia or whether they constitute a separate earlier disorder is not clear
associated laboratory findings no laboratory findings have been identified that are diagnostic of schizophrenia however a variety of laboratory findings have been noted to be abnormal in groups of individuals with schizophrenia relative to control subjects structural abnormalities in the brain have consistently been demonstrated in individuals with schizophrenia as a group the most common structural abnormalities include enlargement of the ventricular system and prominent sulci in the cortex a variety of other abnormalities have also been noted using structural imaging techniquesdecreased temporal and hippocampal size increased size of the basal ganglia decreased cerebral size functional imaging techniques have indicated that some individuals may have abnormal cerebral blood flow or glucose utilization in specific brain regionsprefrontal cortex neuropsychological assessments may show a broad range of dysfunc- tionsdifficulty in changing response set focusing attention formulating abstract concepts neurophysiological findings include a slowing in reaction times abnormalitie in eye tracking or impairments in sensory gating abnormal laboratory findings may also be noted as either a complication of schizophrenia or of its treatment some individuals with schizophrenia drink excessive amounts of fluid water intoxication and develop abnormalities in urine specific gravity or electrolyte imbalances elevated creatine phosphokinase cpk may result from neuroleptic malignant syndrome see p 739
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
individuals with schizophrenia are sometimes physically awkward and may display neurological soft signs such as left/right confusion poor coordination or mirroring some minor physical anomalieshighly arched palate narrow- or wide-set eyes or subtle malformations of the ears may be more common among individuals with schizophrenia perhaps the most common associated physical findings are motor abnormalities most of these are likely to be related to side effects from treatment with antipsychotic medications motor abnormalities that are secondary to neuroleptic treatment include neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia see p 747 neuroleptic- induced parkinsonism see p 736 neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia see p 744 neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia see p 742 and neuroleptic malignant syndrome see p 739 spontaneous motor abnormalities resembling those that may be induced by neurolepticssniffing tongue clucking grunting had been described in the preneuroleptic era and are also still observed although they may be difficult to distinguish from neuroleptic effects other physical findings may be related to frequently associated disorders for example because nicotine dependence is so common in
schizophrenia these individuals are more likely to develop cigarette-related pathologyemphysema and other pulmonary and cardiac problems
specific culture age and gender features
clinicians assessing the symptoms of schizophrenia in socioeconomic or cultural situations that are different from their own must take cultural differences into account ideas that may appear to be delusional in one culturesorcery and witchcraft may be commonly held in another in some cultures visual or auditory hallucinationswith a religious content may be a normal part of religious experienceseeing the virgin mary or hearing god's voice in addition the assessment of disorganized speech may be made difficult by linguistic variation in narrative styles across cultures that affects the logical form of verbal presentation the assessment of affect requires sensitivity to differences in styles of emotional expression eye contact and body language which vary across cultures if the assessment is conducted in a language that is different from the individual's primary language care must be taken to ensure that alogia is not related to linguisticbarriers because the culturalmeaning of self-initiated goal-directed activity can be expected to vary across diverse settings disturbances of volition must also be carefully assessed there is some evidence that clinicians may have a tendency to overdiagnose schizophrenia instead of bipolar disorder in some ethnic groups cultural differences have been noted in the presentation course and outcome of schizophrenia catatonic behavior has been reported as relatively uncommon among individuals with schizophrenia in the united states but is more common in non-western countries individuals with schizophrenia in developing nations tend to have a more acute course and a better outcome than do individuals in industrialized nations
the onset of schizophrenia typically occurs between the late teens and the mid-30s with onset prior to adolescence rare although cases with age at onset of 5 or 6 years have been reported the essential features of the condition are the same in children but it may be particularlydifficult to make the diagnosis in this age group in children delusions and hallucinations may be less elaborated than those observed in adults and visual hallucinations may be more common disorganized speech is observed in a number of disorders with childhood onsetcommunication disorders pervasive developmental disorders as is disorganized behaviorattention-deficit/hyperac- tivity disorder stereotypic movement disorder these symptoms should not be attributed to schizophrenia without due consideration of these more common disorders of childhood schizophrenia can also begin later in lifeafter age 45 years late-onset cases tend to be similar to earlier-onset schizophrenia except for a higher ratio of women a better occupational history and a greater frequency of having been married the clinical presentation is more likely to include paranoid delusions and hallucinations and less likely to include disorganized and negative symptoms the course is usually chronic although individuals are often quite responsive to antipsychotic medications in lower doses among those with the oldest age at onset ie over age 60 years sensory deficitshearing loss apparently occur more commonly than in the general adult population their specific role in pathogenesis remains unknown
there are gender differences in the presentation and course of schizophrenia women are more likely to have a later onset more prominent mood symptoms and a better prognosis although it has long been held that males and females are affected in roughly equal numbers estimates of sex ratio are confounded by issues of ascertainmentschizophrenia 281
282 schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
and definition hospital-based studies suggest a higher rate of schizophrenia in males whereas community-based surveys have mostly suggested an equal sex ratio broader definitions of schizophrenia with respect to the boundary with mood disorders will yield a higher female-to-male ratio than the relatively narrow construct of schizophrenia used in this manual
prevalence
there is variabilityin the reported prevalence of schizophrenia because different studies haveused different methods ofascertainmentegruralversusurbancommunityversus clinic or hospital and different definitions of schizophrenia narrow versus broad criterion-based versus clinical estimates of prevalence have ranged from 02% to 20% across many large studies prevalence rates are similar throughout the world but pockets of high prevalence have been reported in some specific areas taking all these sources of information into account the lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is usually estimated to be between 05% and 1% because schizophrenia tends to be chronic incidence rate are considerably lower than prevalence rates and are estimated to be approximately 1 per 10000 per year
course
the median age at onset for the first psychotic episode of schizophrenia is in the early to mid-20s for men and in the late 20s for women the onset may be abrupt or insidious but the majority of individuals display some type of prodromal phase manifested by the slow and gradual development of a variety of signs and symptomssocial withdrawal loss of interest in school or work deterioration in hygiene and grooming unusual behavior outbursts of anger family members may find this behavior difficult to interpret and assume that the person is going through a phase eventually however the appearance of some active-phase symptom marks the disturbance as schizophrenia the age at onset may have both pathophysiological and prognostic significance individuals with an early age at onset are more often male and have a poorer premorbid adjustment lower educational achievement more evidence of structural brain abnor- malities more prominent negative signs and symptoms more evidence of cognitive impairment as assessed with neuropsychological testing and a worse outcome con- versely individuals with a later onset are more often female have less evidence of structural brain abnormalities or cognitive impairment and display a better outcome
most studies of course and outcome in schizophrenia suggest that the course may be variable with some individuals displaying exacerbations and remissions whereas others remain chronically ill because of variability in definition and ascertainment an accurate summary of the long-term outcome of schizophrenia is not possible complete remission ie a return to full premorbid functioning is probably not common in this disorder of those who remain ill some appear to have a relatively stable course whereas others show a progressive worsening associated with severe disability early in the illness negative symptoms may be prominent appearing primarily as prodromal features subsequently positive symptoms appear because these positive symptoms are partic- ularly responsive to treatment they typically diminish but in many individuals negative symptoms persist between episodes of positive symptoms there is some suggestion that negative symptoms may become steadily more prominent in some individuals during
the course of the illness numerous studies have indicated a group of factors that are associated with a better prognosis these include good premorbid adjustment acute onset later age at onset being female precipitating events associated mood disturbance brief duration of active-phase symptoms good interepisode functioning minimal residual symptoms absence of structural brain abnormalities normal neurological functioning a family history of mood disorder and no family history of schizophrenia
familial pattern
the first-degree biological relatives of individuals with schizophrenia have a risk for schizophrenia that is about 10 times greater than that of the general population concordance rates for schizophrenia are higher in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins adoption studies have shown that biological relatives of individuals with schizophrenia have a substantially increased risk for schizophrenia whereas adoptive relatives have no increased risk although much evidence suggests the importance of genetic factors in the etiology of schizophrenia the existence of a substantial discordance rate in monozygotic twins also indicates the importance of environmental factors
differential diagnosis
a wide variety of general medical conditions can present with psychotic symptoms
psychotic disorder due to a general medicalcondition delirium or dementia
is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory tests that indicates that the delusions or hallucinations are the direct physiological consequence of a general medical conditioncushing's syndrome brain tumor see p 306 substance-induced psychotic disorder substance-induced delirium and substance-induced persisting dementia are distinguished from schizophrenia by the fact that a substancea drug of abuse a medication or exposure to a toxin is judged to be etiologically related to the delusions or hallucinations see p 310 man different types of substance-related disorders may produce symptoms similar to those of schizophreniasustained amphetamine or cocaine use may produce delusions or hallucinations phencyclidine use may produce a mixture of positive and negative symptoms based on a variety of features that characterize the course of schizophrenia and substance-related disorders the clinician must determine whether the psychotic symptoms have been initiated and maintained by the substance use ideally the clinician should attempt to observe the individual during a sustained period4 weeks of abstinence however because such prolonged periods of abstinence are often difficult to achieve the clinician may need to consider other evidence such as whether the psychotic symptoms appear to be exacerbated by the substance and to diminish when it has been discontinued the relative severity of psychotic symptoms in relation to the amount and duration of substance use and knowledge of the characteristic symptoms produced by a particular substanceamphetamines typically produce delusions and stereotypies but not affective blunting or prominent negative symptoms
distinguishing schizophrenia from mood disorder with psychotic features an schizoaffectivedisorder is made difficult by the fact that mood disturbance is common during the prodromal active and residual phases of schizophrenia if psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during periods of mood disturbance the diagnosis is mood disorder with psychotic features in schizoaffective disorder there must be a moodschizophrenia 283
284 schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
episode that is concurrent with the active-phase symptoms of schizophrenia mood symptoms must be present for a substantial portion of the total duration of the disturbance and delusions or hallucinations must be present for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms in contrast mood symptoms in schizophrenia either have a duration that is brief in relation to the total duration of the disturbance occur only during the prodromal or residual phases or do not meet full criteria for a mood episode when mood symptoms that meet full criteria for a mood episode are superimposed on schizophrenia and are of particular clinical significance an additional diagnosisofdepressivedisordernototherwisespecified orbipolardisordernot otherwise specified may be given schizophrenia catatonic type may be difficult to distinguish from a mood disorder with catatonic features
by definition schizophrenia differs from schizophreniform disorder on the basis of duration schizophrenia involves the presence of symptoms including prodromal or residual symptoms for at least 6 months whereas the total duration of symptoms in schizophreniform disorder must be at least 1 month but less than 6 months schizophreniform disorder also does not require a decline in functioning brief psychotic disorder is defined by the presence of delusions hallucinations disorga- nized speech or grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior lasting for at least 1 day but for less than 1month
the differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and delusional disorder rests on the nature of the delusions nonbizarre in delusional disorder and the absence of other characteristic symptoms of schizophreniahallucinations disorganized speech or behavior or prominent negative symptoms delusional disorder is particu- larly difficult to differentiate from the paranoid type of schizophrenia because this subtype does not include prominent disorganized speech disorganized behavior orflat or inappropriate affect and is often associated with less decline in functioning than is characteristic of the other subtypes of schizophrenia when poor psychosocial function- ing is present in delusional disorder it arises directly from the delusional beliefs themselves
a diagnosis of psychotic disorder not otherwise specified may be made if insufficient information is available to choose between schizophrenia and other psy- chotic disordersschizoaffective disorder or to determine whether the presenting symptoms are substance induced or are the result of a general medical condition such uncertainty is particularlylikely to occur early in the course of the disorder
although schizophrenia and pervasive developmental disordersautistic disorder share disturbances in language affect and interpersonal relatedness they can be distinguished in a number of ways pervasive developmental disorders are charac- teristically recognized during infancy or early childhood usually before age 3 years whereas such early onset is rare in schizophrenia moreover in pervasive developmental disorders there is an absence of prominent delusions and hallucinations more pronounced abnormalities in affect and speech that is absent or minimal and charac- terized by stereotypies and abnormalities in prosody schizophrenia may occasionally develop in individuals with a pervasive developmental disorder a diagnosis of schizophrenia is warranted in individuals with a preexisting diagnosis of autistic disorder or another pervasive developmental disorder only if prominent hallucinations or delusions have been present for at least a month childhood-onset schizophrenia must be distinguished from childhood presentations combining disorganized speech from a communication disorder and disorganized behavior from attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder
schizophrenia shares featuresparanoid ideation magical thinking social avoidance and vague and digressive speech with and may be preceded by schizotypal schizoid or paranoid personality disorder an additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is appropriate when the symptoms are severe enough to satisfy criterion a of schizophrenia the preexisting personality disorder may be noted on axis ii followed by premorbid in parentheses [eg schizotypal personality disorder premorbid]
â€¢ diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia
a characteristic symptoms two or more of the following each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period or less if successfully treated
1 delusions
2 hallucinations
3 disorganized speechfrequent derailment or incoherence
4 grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
5 negative symptoms ie affective flattening alogia or avolition
note only one criterion a symptom is required if delusions are bizarre or hallucinations consist of a voice keeping up a running commentary on the person's behavior or thoughts or two or more voices conversing with each other
b social/occupational dysfunction for a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance one or more major areas of functioning such as work interpersonal relations or self-care are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal academic or occupational achievement
c duration continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months this 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms or less if successfully treated that meet criterion a ie active-phase symptoms and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms during these prodromal or residual periods the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or two or more symptoms listed in criterion a present in an attenuated formodd beliefs unusual perceptual experiences

f relationship to a pervasivedevelopmental disorder if there is a history of autistic disorder or another pervasive developmental disorder the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delu- sions or hallucinations are also present for at least a month or less if successfully treated
classification of longitudinal course can be applied only after at least 1year has elapsed since the initial onset of active-phase symptoms
episodic with interepisode residual symptoms episodes are defined by the reemergence of prominent psychotic symptoms also specify if with prominent negative symptoms
episodic with no interepisode residual symptoms
continuous prominent psychotic symptoms are present throughout the
period of observation also specify if with prominent negative
symptoms
single episode in partial remission also specify if with prominent
negative symptoms
single episode in full remission other or unspecified pattern
schizophrenia subtypes
the subtypes of schizophrenia are defined by the predominant symptomatology at the time of evaluation although the prognostic and treatment implications of the subtypes are variable the paranoid and disorganized types tend to be the least and most severe respectively the diagnosis of a particular subtype is based on the clinical picture that occasioned the most recent evaluation or admission to clinical care and may therefore change over time not infrequently the presentation may include symptoms that are characteristic of more than one subtype the choice among subtypes depends on the following algorithm catatonic type is assigned whenever prominent catatonic symp- toms are present regardless of the presence of other symptoms disorganized type is assigned whenever disorganized speech and behavior and flat or inappropriate affect are prominent unless catatonic type is also present paranoid type is assigned whenever there is a preoccupation with delusions or frequent hallucinations are prominent unless the catatonic or disorganized type is present undifferentiated type is a residual category describing presentations that include prominent active-phase
symptoms not meeting criteria for the catatonic disorganized or paranoid type and residual type is for presentations in which there is continuing evidence of the disturbance but the criteria for the active-phase symptoms are no longer met
a dimensional alternative to the traditional schizophrenia subtypes is described in appendix b see p 710 the suggested dimensions are the psychotic dimension the disorganized dimension and the negative dimension
29530 paranoid type
the essential feature of the paranoid type of schizophrenia is the presence of prominent delusions or auditory hallucinations in the context of a relative preservation of cognitive functioning and affect symptoms characteristic of the disorganized and catatonic typesdisorganized speech flat or inappropriate affect catatonic or disorganized behavior are not prominent delusions are typically persecutory or grandiose or both but delusions with other themesjealousy religiosity or somatization may also occur the delusions may be multiple but are usually organized around a coherent theme hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme associated features include anxiety anger aloofness and argumentativeness the individual may have a superior and patronizing manner and either a stilted formal quality or extreme intensity in interpersonal interactions the persecutory themes may predis- pose the individual to suicidal behavior and the combination of persecutory and grandiose delusions with anger may predispose the individual to violence onset tends to be later in life than the other types of schizophrenia and the distinguishing characteristics may be more stable over time these individuals usually show little or no impairment on neuropsychological or other cognitive testing some evidence suggests that the prognosis for the paranoid type may be considerably better than for the other types of schizophrenia particularly with regard to occupational functioning and capacity for independent living
diagnostic criteria for 29530 paranoid type

a type of schizophrenia in which the following criteria are met
a all of the following are prominent
1 disorganized speech
2 disorganized behavior
3 flat or inappropriate affect
b the criteria are not met for catatonic type
29520 catatonic type
the essential feature of the catatonic type of schizophrenia is a marked psychomotor disturbance that may involve motoric immobility excessive motor activity extreme negativism mutism peculiarities of voluntary movement echolalia or echopraxia motoric immobility may be manifested by catalepsy waxy flexibility or stupor the excessive motor activity is apparently purposeless and is not influenced by external stimuli there may be extreme negativism that is manifested by the maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved or resistance to all instructions peculiaritie of voluntary movement are manifested by the voluntary assumption of inappropriate or bizarre postures or by prominent grimacing echolalia is the pathological parrotlike and apparently senseless repetition of a word or phrase just spoken by another person echopraxia is the repetitive imitation of the movements of another person additional features include stereotypies mannerisms and automatic obedience or mimicry during severe catatonic stupor or excitement the person may need careful supervision to avoid self-harm or harming others there are potential risks from malnutritionexhaustion hyperpyrexia or self-inflicted injury to diagnose this subtype the individual's presen- tation must first meet the full criteria for schizophrenia and not be better accounted for by another etiology substance inducedneuroleptic-induced parkinsonism see p 736 a general medical condition see p 169 or a manic or major depressive episode see p 382
diagnostic criteria for 29520 catatonictype
a type of schizophrenia in which the clinical picture is dominated by at least two of the following
1 motoric immobility as evidenced by catalepsy including waxy flexibility or stupor
2 excessive motor activity that is apparently purposeless and not influenced by external stimuli
3 extreme negativism an apparently motiveless resistance to all instructions or maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved or mutism
4 peculiarities of voluntary movement as evidenced by posturing voluntary assumption of inappropriate or bizarre postures ste- reotyped movements prominent mannerisms or prominent gri- macing
5 echolalia or echopraxia
29590 undifferentiated type
the essential feature of the undifferentiated type of schizophrenia is the presence of symptoms that meet criterion a of schizophrenia but that do not meet criteria for the paranoid disorganized or catatonic type
diagnostic criteria for 29590 undifferentiated type
a type of schizophrenia in which symptoms that meet criterion a are present but the criteria are not met for the paranoid disorganized or catatonic type
29560 residual type
the residual type of schizophrenia should be used when there has been at least one episode of schizophrenia but the current clinical picture is without prominent positive psychotic symptomsdelusions hallucinations disorganized speech or behavior there is continuing evidence of the disturbance as indicated by the presence of negative symptomsflat affect poverty of speech or avolition or two or more attenuated positive symptomseccentric behavior mildly disorganized speech or odd beliefs if delusions or hallucinations are present they are not prominent and are not accompa- nied by strong affect the course of the residualtype may be time limited and represent a transition between a full-blown episode and complete remission however it may also be continuously present for many years with or without acute exacerbationsschizophrenia 289

b there is continuing evidence of the disturbance as indicated by the presence of negative symptoms or two or more symptoms listed in criterion a for schizophrenia present in an attenuated formodd beliefs unusual perceptual experiences

29540 schizophreniform disorder

the essential features of schizophreniform disorder are identical to those of schizophre- nia criterion a except for two differences the total duration of the illness including prodromal active and residual phases is at least 1 month but less than 6 months criterion b and impaired social or occupational functioning during some part of the illness is not required although it may occur the duration requirement for schizophreniform disorder is intermediate between that for brief psychotic disorder in which symptoms last for at least 1 day but for less than 1 month and schizophrenia in which the symptoms persist for at least 6 months the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made under two conditions in the first the diagnosis is applied without qualification to an episode of illness of between 1 and 6 months' duration from which the individual has already recovered in the second instance the diagnosis is applied when a person who although symptomatic has been so for less than the 6 months required for a diagnosis of schizophrenia in this case the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder should be qualified as provisional because there is no certainty that the individual will actually recover from the disturbance within the 6-month period if the disturbance persists beyond 6 months the diagnosis would be changed to schizophrenia
specifiers
the following specifiers for schizophreniform disorder may be used to indicate the presence or absence of features that may be associated with a better prognosis
with good prognostic features this specifier is used if at least two of the following features are present onset of prominent psychotic symptoms within 4 weeks of the first noticeable change in usual behavior or functioning confusion or perplexity at the height of the psychotic episode good premorbid social and occupational functioning and absence of blunted or flat affectwithout good prognostic features this specifier is used if two or more of the above features have not been present
29540 schizophreniform disorder 291
associated features and disorders
also see the discussion in the associated features and disorders section for schizo- phrenia p 279- unlike schizophrenia impairment in social or occupationalfunctioning is not required for a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder however most individuals do experience dysfunction in various areas of daily functioningwork or school interpersonal relationships and self-care
specific cultureage and gender features
for additional discussion of culture ageand gender factors relevant to the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder see the specific culture age and gender features section for schizophrenia p 281 there are suggestions that in developing countries recover from psychotic disorders may be more rapid which would result in higher rates of schizophreniform disorder than of schizophrenia
prevalence
community studies have reported a lifetime prevalence of schizophreniform disorder of around 02%with a 1-year prevalence of01%
course
there is little available information on the course of schizophreniform disorder approximately one-third of individuals with an initial diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder provisional recover within the 6-month period and receive schizophreniform disorder as their final diagnosis the remaining two-thirds will progress to the diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
differential diagnosis
because the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder differ primarily in terms of duration of illness the discussion of the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia p 283 also applies to schizophreniform disorder schizophreniform disorder differs from brief psychotic disorder which has a duration of less than 1 month
diagnostic criteria for 29540 schizophreniform disorder

following
1 onset of prominent psychotic symptoms within 4 weeks of the first
noticeable change in usual behavior or functioning2 confusion or perplexity at the height of the psychotic episode3 good premorbid social and occupational functioning4 absence of blunted or flat affect

29570 schizoaffective disorder

the essential feature of schizoaffective disorder is an uninterrupted period of illness during which at some time there is a major depressive manic or mixed episode concurrent with symptoms that meet criterion a for schizophrenia criterion a in addition during the same period of illness there have been delusions or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms criterion b finally the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total duration of the illness criterion c the symptoms must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substancecocaine or a general medical conditionhyperthyroidism or temporal lobe epilepsy criteriond to meet criteria for schizoaffective disorder the essential features must occur within a single uninterrupted period of illness the phrase period of illness as used here refers to a time period during which the individual continues to display active or residual symptoms of psychotic illness for some individuals this period of illness may last for years or even decades a period of illness is considered to have ended when the individual has completely recovered for a significant interval of time and no longer demonstrates any significant symptoms of the disorder
the phase of the illness with concurrent mood and psychotic symptoms is characterized by the full criteria being met for both the active phase of schizophrenia ie criterion a see p 274 and for a major depressive episode p 320 a mani episode p 328 or a mixed episode p 333 the duration of the major depressiv episode must be at least 2 weeks the duration of the manic or mixed episode must be at least 1 week because the psychotic symptoms must have a total duration of at least 1 month to meet criterion a for schizophrenia the minimum duration of a schizoaffective episode is also 1 month an essential feature of a major depressive episode is the presence of either depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure because loss of interest or pleasure is so common in nonaffective psychotic disorders to meet criterion a for schizoaffective disorder the major depressive episode must include pervasive depressed mood ie the presence of markedly diminished interest or pleasure is not sufficient the phase of the illness with psychotic symptoms alone is characterized by delusions or hallucinationsthat last at least 2 weeks although some mood symptoms
29570 schizoaffective disorder 293
may be present during this phase they are not prominent this determination can be difficult and may require longitudinal observation and multiple sources of information the symptoms of schizoaffective disorder may occur in a variety of temporal patterns the following is a typical pattern an individual may have pronounced auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions for 2 months before the onset of a prominent major depressive episode the psychotic symptoms and the full major depressive episode are then present for 3 months then the person recovers completely from the major depressive episode but the psychotic symptoms persist for another month before theytoo disappearduringthisperiod ofillnessthe individual'ssymptomsconcurrently met criteria for a major depressive episode and criterion a for schizophrenia and during this same period of illness auditory hallucinations and delusions were present both before and after the depressive phase the total period of illness lasted for about 6 months with psychotic symptoms alone present during the initial 2 months both depressive and psychotic symptoms present during the next 3 months and psychotic symptoms alone present during the last month in this instance the duration of the depressive episode was not brief relative to the total duration of the psychotic disturbance and thus the presentation qualifies for a diagnosis of schizoaffective
disorder
criterion c for schizoaffective disorder specifies that mood symptoms that meet
criteria for a mood episode must be present for a substantial portion of the entire period of illness if the mood symptoms are present for only a relatively brief period of time the diagnosis is schizophrenia not schizoaffective disorder in evaluating this criterion the clinician should determine the proportion of time during the continuous period of psychotic illness ie both active and residual symptoms in which there were significant mood symptoms accompanying the psychotic symptoms the operationalization of what is meant by a substantial portion of time requires clinical judgment for example an individual with a 4-year history of active and residual symptoms of schizophrenia develops a superimposed major depressive episode that lasts for 5 weeks during which the psychotic symptoms persist this presentation would not meet the criterion for a substantial portion of the total duration because the symptoms that meet criteria for a mood episode occurred for only 5 weeks out of a total of 4 years of disturbance the diagnosis in this example remains schizophrenia with the additional diagnosis of depressive disorder not otherwise specified to indicate the superimposed major depressive episode
subtypes
two subtypes of schizoaffective disorder may be noted based on the mood component of the disorder
bipolar type this subtype applies if a manic episode or mixed episode is part of the presentation major depressive episodes may also occur
depressive type this subtype applies if only major depressive episodes are part of the presentation
associated features and disorders
there may be poor occupational functioning a restricted range of social contact difficulties with self-care and increased risk of suicide associated with schizoaffective disorder residual and negative symptoms are usually less severe and less chronic than
294 schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
those seen in schizophrenia individuals with schizoaffective disorder may be at increased risk for later developing episodes of pure mood disordermajor depressive or bipolar disorder or of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder there may be associated alcohol and other substance-relateddisorders limitedclinical evidence suggests that schizoaffective disorder may be preceded by schizoid schizotypal borderline or paranoid personality disorder

for additional discussion of culture age and gender factors relevant to evaluating psychotic symptoms see the text for schizophrenia p 281and for a discussion of such factors relevant to diagnosing mood disorders see p 341 and p 352 schizoaffective disorder bipolar type may be more common in young adults whereas schizoaffective disorder depressive type may be more common in older adults compared with schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder probably occurs more often in women
prevalence
detailed information is lacking but schizoaffective disorder appears to be less common than schizophrenia
course
the typical age at onset of schizoaffective disorder is probably in early adulthood although onset can occur anywhere from adolescence to late in life the prognosis for schizoaffective disorder is somewhat better than the prognosis for schizophrenia but considerably worse than the prognosis for mood disorders substantial occupational and social dysfunction are not uncommon the outcome for schizoaffective disorder bipolar type may be better than that for schizoaffective disorder depressive type
familial pattern
there is substantial evidence that there is an increased risk for schizophrenia in first-degree biological relatives of individuals with schizoaffective disorder most studies also show that relatives of individuals with schizoaffective disorder are at increased risk for mood disorders
differential diagnosis
general medical conditions and substance use can present with a combination of psychotic and mood symptoms psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition a delirium or a dementia is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory tests indicating that the symptoms are the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition see p306 substance-induced psychotic disorder and substance-induced delirium are dis- tinguished from schizoaffective disorder by the fact that a substancea drug of abuse a medication or exposure to a toxin is judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms see p 310distinguishing schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia and from mood disorder
29570 schizoaffective disorder 295
with psychotic features is often difficult in schizoaffective disorder there must be a mood episode that is concurrent with the active-phase symptoms of schizophrenia mood symptoms must be present for a substantial portion of the total duration of the disturbance and delusions or hallucinations must be present for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms in contrast mood symptoms in schizophrenia either have a duration that is brief relative to the total duration of the disturbance occur only during the prodromal or residual phases or do not meet full criteria for a mood episode if psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during periods of mood disturbance the diagnosis is mood disorder with psychotic features in schizoaffective disorder symptoms should not be counted toward a mood episode if they are clearly the result of symptoms of schizophreniadifficulty sleeping because of disturbing auditory hallucinations weight loss because food is considered poisoned difficulty concentrating because of psychotic disorganization loss of interest or pleasure is common in nonaffective psychotic disorders therefore to meet criterion a for schizoaffective disorder the major depressive episode must include pervasive depressed mood
because the relative proportion of mood to psychotic symptoms may change over the course of the disturbance the appropriate diagnosis for an individual episode of illness may change from schizoaffective disorder to schizophreniaa diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder for a severe and prominent major depressive episode lasting 3 months during the first 6 months of a chronic psychotic illness would be changed to schizophrenia if active psychotic or prominent residual symptoms persist over several years without a recurrence of another mood episode the diagnosis may also change for different episodes of illness separated by a period of recovery for example an individual may have an episode of psychotic symptoms that meet criterion a for schizophrenia during a major depressive episode recover fully from this episode and then later develop 6 weeks of delusions and hallucinations without prominent mood symptoms the diagnosis in this instance would not be schizoaffective disorder because the period of delusions and hallucinations was not continuous with the initial period of disturbance instead the appropriate diagnoses for the first episode would be mood disorder with psychotic features in full remission and schizophreniform disorder provisional for the current episode
mood disturbances especially depression commonly develop during the course of delusional disorder however such presentations do not meet criteria for schizoaffec- tive disorder because the psychotic symptoms in delusional disorder are restricted to nonbizarre delusions and therefore do not meet criteriona for schizoaffective disorder
if there is insufficient information concerning the relationship between psychotic and mood symptoms psychotic disorder not otherwise specified may be the most appropriate diagnosis

2971 delusional disorder

the essential feature of delusional disorder is the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions that persist for at least 1 month criterion a a diagnosis of delusional disorder is not given if the individual has ever had a symptom presentation that met criterion a for schizophrenia criterion b auditory or visual hallucinations if present are not prominent tactile or olfactory hallucinations may be present and prominent if they are related to the delusional themethe sensation of being infested with insects associated with delusions of infestation or the perception that one emits a foul odor from a body orifice associated with delusions of reference apart from the direct impact of the delusions psychosocial functioning is not markedly impaired and behavior is neither obviously odd nor bizarre criterion c if mood episodes occur concurrently with the delusions the total duration of these mood episodes is relativelybrief compared to the total duration of the delusional periods criterion d the delusions are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substancecocaine or a general medical conditionalzheimer's disease systemic lupus erythematosus criterione
although the determination of whether delusions are bizarre is considered to be especially important in distinguishing between delusional disorder and schizophrenia bizarreness may be difficult to judge especially across different cultures delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible not understandable and not derived from ordinary life experiencesan individual's belief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and replaced them with someone else's organs without leaving any
wounds or scars in contrast nonbizarre delusions involve situations that can conceiv- ably occur in real lifebeing followed poisoned infected loved at a distance or deceived by one's spouse or lover
psychosocial functioning is variable some individuals may appear to be relatively unimpaired in their interpersonal and occupational roles in others the impairment may be substantial and include low or absent occupational functioning and social isolation when poor psychosocial functioning is present in delusional disorder it arises directly from the delusional beliefs themselves for example an individual who is convinced that he will be murdered by mafia hit men may quit his job and refuse to leave his house except late at night and only when dressed in clothes quite different from his normal attire allof this behavior is an understandable attempt to prevent being identified and killed by his presumed assassins in contrast poor functioning in schizophrenia may be due to both positive and negative symptoms particularly avolition similarly a common characteristic of individuals with delusional disorder is the apparent normality of their behavior and appearance when their delusional ideas are not being discussed or acted on in general social and marital functioning are more likely to be impaired than intellectual and occupational functioning
subtypes
the type of delusional disorder may be specified based on the predominant delusional theme
erotomanictype this subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is that another person is in love with the individual the delusion often concerns idealized romantic love and spiritual union rather than sexual attraction the person about whom this conviction is held is usually of higher statusa famous person or a superior at work but can be a complete stranger efforts to contact the object of the delusion through telephone calls letters gifts visits and even surveillance and stalking are common although occasionally the person keeps the delusion secret most individuals with this subtype in clinical samples are female most individuals with this subtype in forensic samples are male some individuals with this subtype particularlymales come into conflict with the law in their efforts to pursue the object of their delusion or in a misguided effort to rescue him or her from some imagined danger
grandiose type this subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is the conviction of having some great but unrecognized talent or insight or having made some important discovery less commonly the individual may have the delusion of having a special relationship with a prominent personan adviser to the president or being a prominent person in which case the actual person may be regarded as an impostor grandiose delusions may have a religious contentthe person believes that he or she has a special message from a deity
jealous type this subtype applies when the central theme of the person's delusion is that his or her spouse or lover is unfaithful this belief is arrived at without due cause and is based on incorrect inferences supported by small bits of evidencedisarrayed clothing or spots on the sheets which are collected and used to justify the delusion the individualwith the delusion usually confronts the spouse or lover and attempts to intervene in the imagined infidelity2971 delusional disorder 297
298
schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
eg restricting the spouse's autonomy secretly following the spouse investigat- ing the imagined lover attacking the spouse
persecutorytype this subtype applies when the central theme ofthe delusion involves the person's belief that he or she is being conspired against cheated spied on followed poisoned or drugged maliciously maligned harassed or obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals small slights may be exaggerated and become the focus of a delusional system the focus of the delusion is often on some injustice that must be remedied by legal action querulous paranoia and the affected person may engage in repeated attempts to obtain satisfaction by appeal to the courts and other government agencies individuals with persecutory delusions are often resentful and angry and may resort to violence against those they believe are hurting them
somatic type this subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion involves bodily functions or sensations somatic delusions can occur in several forms most common are the person's conviction that he or she emits a foul odor from the skin mouth rectum or vagina that there is an infestation of insects on or in the skin that there is an internal parasite that certain parts of the body are definitely contrary to all evidence misshapen or ugly or that parts of the bodythe large intestine are not functioning
mixed type this subtype applies when no one delusional theme predominates unspecified type this subtype applies when the dominant delusional belief cannot be clearly determined or is not described in the specific typesreferential delusions without a prominent persecutory or grandiose component
associated features and disorders
social marital or work problems can result from the delusional beliefs of delusional disorder ideas of referencethat random events are of special significance are common in individuals with this disorder their interpretation of these events is usually consistent with the content of their delusional beliefs many individuals with delusional disorder develop irritable or dysphoric mood which can usually be understood as a reaction to their delusional beliefs especially with the persecutory and jealous types marked anger and violent behavior can occur the individual may engage in litigious behavior sometimes leading to hundreds of letters of protest to government and judicial officials and many court appearances legal difficulties can occur in delusional disorder jealous type and erotomanic type individuals with delusional disorder somatic type may be subject to unnecessary medical tests and procedures hearing deficiency severe psychosocial stressorsimmigration and low socioeconomic status may predispose an individual to the development of delusional disorder major depressive episodes probably occur in individuals with delusional disorder more frequently than in the general population typicallythe depression isrelativelymildand begins after the onset of prominent delusional beliefs delusional disorder may be associated with obsessive- compulsive disorder body dysmorphic disorder and paranoid schizoid or avoidant personality disorders
specific culture and gender featuresan individual's cultural and religious background must be taken into account in evaluating the possible presence of delusional disorder some cultures have widely
held and culturally sanctioned beliefs that might be considered delusional in other cultures the content of delusions also varies in different cultures and subcultures delusional disorder jealous type is probably more common in men than in women but there appears to be no major gender difference in the overall frequency of delusional disorder
prevalence
delusional disorder is relatively uncommon in clinical settings with most studies suggesting that the disorder accounts for l%-2% of admissions to inpatient mental health facilities precise information about the population prevalence of this disorder islacking but the best estimate is around 003% because of its usually late age at onset the lifetime morbidity risk may be between 005% and 01%
course
the age at onset of delusional disorder is generally middle or late adult life but can be at a younger age the persecutory type is the most common subtype the course is quite variable especially in the persecutory type the disorder may be chronic although a waxing and waning of the preoccupation with the delusional beliefs often occurs in other cases full periods of remission may be followed by subsequent relapses in yet other cases the disorder remits within a few months often without subsequent relapse some evidence suggests that the jealous type may have a better prognosis than the persecutory type
familial pattern
some studies have found that delusional disorder is more common among relatives of individuals with schizophrenia than would be expected by chance whereas other studies have found no familial relationship between delusional disorder and schizo- phrenia there is limited evidence that avoidant and paranoid personality disorders may be especially common among first-degree biological relatives of individuals with delusional disorder
differential diagnosis
the diagnosis of delusional disorder is made only when the delusion is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition adelirium a dementia and psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition may present with symptoms that suggest delusional disorder for example simple persecu- tory delusionssomeone comes into my room at night and steals my clothes in the early phase of dementia of the alzheimer's type would be diagnosed as dementia of the alzheimer'stype with delusions a substance-inducedpsychotic disorder especially due to stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine cross-sectionally may be identical in symptomatology to delusional disorder but can usually be distinguished by the chronological relationship of substance use to the onset and remission of the delusional beliefsdelusional disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia andschizophreni-2971 delusional disorder 299
300 schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
form disorder by the absence of the other characteristicsymptoms of the active phase of schizophreniaprominent auditory or visual hallucinations bizarre delusions disorganized speech grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior negative symptoms compared with schizophrenia delusional disorder usually produces less impairment in occupational and social functioning
it can be difficult to differentiate mood disorders with psychotic features from delusional disorder because the psychotic features associated with mood disorders usually involve nonbizarre delusions without prominent hallucinations and delusional disorder frequently has associated mood symptoms the distinction depends on the temporal relationship between the mood disturbance and the delusions and on the severity of the mood symptoms if delusions occur exclusively during mood episodes the diagnosis is mood disorder with psychotic features although depressive symptoms are common in delusional disorder they are usually mild remit while the delusional symptoms persist and do not warrant a separate mood disorder diagnosis occasionally mood symptoms that meet full criteria for a mood episode are superimposed on the delusional disturbance delusional disorder can be diagnosed only if the total duration of all mood episodes remains brief relative to the total duration of the delusional disturbance if symptoms that meet criteria for a mood episode are present for a substantial portion of the delusional disturbance ie the delusional equivalent of schizoaffective disorder then a diagnosis of psychotic disorder not otherwise specified accompanied by either depressive disorder not otherwise specified or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is appropriate
individuals with shared psychotic disorder can present with symptoms that are similar to those seen in delusional disorder but the disturbance has a characteristic etiology and course in shared psychotic disorder the delusions arise in the context of a close relationship with another person are identical in form to the delusions of that other person and diminish or disappear when the individual with shared psychotic disorder is separated from the individual with the primary psychotic disorder brief psychotic disorder is differentiated from delusional disorder by the fact that the delusional symptoms last less than 1 month a diagnosis of psychotic disorder not otherwise specified may be made if insufficient information is available to choose between delusional disorder and other psychotic disorders or to determine whether the presenting symptoms are substance induced or the result of a general medical condition
it may be difficult to differentiate hypochondriasis especially with poor insight from delusional disorder in hypochondriasis the fears of having a serious disease or the concern that one has such a serious disease are held with less than delusional intensity ie the individual can entertain the possibility that the feared disease is not present body dysmorphic disorder involves a preoccupation with some imagined defect in appearance many individuals with this disorder hold their beliefs with less than delusional intensity and recognize that their view of their appearance is distorted however a significant proportion of individualswhose symptoms meet criteriafor body dysmorphic disorder hold their beliefs with delusional intensity when criteria for both disorders are met both body dysmorphic disorder and delusional disorder somatic type may be diagnosed the boundary between obsessive-compulsive disorder especially with poor insight and delusional disorder can sometimes be difficult to establish the ability of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder to recognize that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable occurs on a contin- uum in some individuals reality testing may be lost and the obsession may reach
delusional proportionsthe belief that one has caused the death of another person by having willed it if the obsessions develop into sustained delusional beliefs that represent a major part of the clinical picture an additional diagnosis of delusional disorder may be appropriate
in contrast to delusional disorder there are no clear-cut or persisting delusional beliefs in paranoid personality disorder whenever a person with a delusional disorder has a preexisting personality disorder the personality disorder should be listed on axis ii followed by premorbid in parentheses

specifiers
the following specifiers for brief psychotic disorder may be noted based on the presence or absence of precipitatingstressors
with marked stressors this specifier may be noted if the psychotic symp- toms develop shortly after and apparently in response to one or more events that singly or together would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in that person's culture this type of brief psychotic disorder was called brief reactive psychosis in dsm-iii-r the precipitating events may be any major stress such as the loss of a loved one or the psychological trauma of combat determining whether a specific stressor was a precipitant or a conse- quence of the illness may sometimes be clinically difficult in such instances the decision will depend on related factors such as the temporal relationship between the stressor and the onset of the symptoms ancillary information from a spouse or friend about level of functioning prior to the stressor and history of similar responses to stressful events in the past
without marked stressors this specifier may be noted if the psychotic symptoms are not apparently in response to events that would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in the person's culture with postpartum onset this specifier may be noted if the onset of the psychotic symptoms is within 4 weeks postpartum
associated features and disorders
individuals with brief psychotic disorder typically experience emotional turmoil or overwhelming confusion they may have rapid shifts from one intense affect to another although brief the level of impairment may be severe and supervision may be required to ensure that nutritional and hygienic needs are met and that the individual is protected from the consequences of poor judgment cognitive impairment or acting on the basis of delusions there appears to be an increased risk of mortalitywith a particularly high risk for suicide especially among younger individuals preexisting personality disordersparanoid histrionic narcissistic schizotypal or borderline personality disorder may predispose the individualto the development of the disorder
2988 brief psychotic disorder 303
specific culture features
it is important to distinguish symptoms of brief psychotic disorder from culturally sanctioned response patterns for example in some religious ceremonies an individual may report hearing voices but these do not generally persist and are not perceived as abnormal by most members of the person's community
prevalence
limited available evidence suggests that brief psychotic disorder is uncommon
course
brief psychotic disorder may appear in adolescence or early adulthood with the average age at onset being in the late 20s or early 30s by definition a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder requires a full remission of all symptoms and a return to the premorbid level of functioning within 1 month of the onset of the disturbance in some individuals the duration of psychotic symptoms may be quite briefa few days
familial pattern
some evidence suggests that brief psychotic disorder may be related to mood disorders whereas other evidence suggests that it may be distinct from both schizophrenia and mood disorders
differential diagnosis
a wide variety of general medical conditions can present with psychotic symptoms of short duration psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition or a delirium is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory tests that indicates that the delusions or hallucinations are the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical conditioncushing's syndrome brain tumor see p 306 substance-induced psychotic disorder sub- stance-induced delirium and substance intoxication are distinguished from brief psychotic disorder by the fact that a substancea drug of abuse a medication or exposure to a toxin is judged to be etiologically related to the psychotic symptoms see p 310 laboratory tests such as a urine drug screen or a blood alcohol level may be helpful in making this determination as may a careful history of substance use with attention to temporal relationships between substance intake and onset of the symptoms and the nature of the substance being used
the diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder cannot be made if the psychotic symptoms are better accounted for by a mood episode ie the psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during a full major depressive manic or mixed episode if the psychotic symptoms persist for 1 month or longer the diagnosis is either schizophreniform disorder delusional disorder mood disorder with psychotic features or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified depending on the other symptoms in the presentation the differential diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder and schizophreniform disorder is difficult when the psychotic symptoms have remitted
304 schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
before 1 month in response to successful treatment with medication because recurrent episodes of brief psychotic disorder are rare careful attention should be given to the possibility that a recurrent disorderbipolar disorder recurrent acute exacerbations of schizophrenia may be responsible for any recurring psychotic episodes
an episode of factitious disorder with predominantly psychological signs and symptoms may have the appearance of brief psychotic disorder but in such cases there is evidence that the symptoms are intentionally produced when malingering involves apparently psychotic symptoms there is usually evidence that the illness was feigned for an understandable goal
in certain individuals with personality disorders psychosocial stressors may precipitate brief periods of psychotic symptoms these are usually transient and do not warrant a separate diagnosis if psychotic symptoms persist for at least 1 day an additional diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder may be appropriate
i diagnostic criteria for 2988 brief psychotic disorder

2973 shared psychotic disorder folie a deux 305 2973 shared psychotic disorder folie a deux

the essential feature of shared psychotic disorder folie a deux is a delusion that develops in an individual who is involved in a close relationship with another person sometimes termed the inducer or the primary case who already has a psychotic disorder with prominent delusions criterion a the individual comes to share the delusional beliefs of the primary case in whole or in part criterion b the delusion is not better accounted for by another psychotic disorderschizophrenia or a mood disorder with psychotic features and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substanceamphetamine or a general medical conditionbrain tumor criterion c schizophrenia is probably the most common diagnosis of the primary case although other diagnoses may include delusional disorder or mood disorder with psychotic features the content of the shared delusional beliefs may be dependent on the diagnosis of the primary case and can include relatively bizarre delusionsthat radiation is being transmitted into an apartment from a hostile foreign power causing indigestion and diarrhea mood-congruent delusionsthat the primary case will soon receive a film contract for $2 million allowing the family to purchase a much larger home with a swimming pool or the nonbizarre delusions that are characteristic of delusional disorderthe fbi is tapping the family telephone and trailing family members when they go out usually the primary case in shared psychotic disorder is dominant in the relationship and gradually imposes the delusional system on the more passive and initially healthy second person individuals who come to share delusional beliefs are often related by blood or marriage and have lived together for a long time sometimes in relative social isolation if the relationship with the primary case is interrupted the delusional beliefs of the other individual usually diminish or disappear although most commonly seen in relationships of only two people shared psychotic disorder can occur among a larger number of individuals especially in family situations in which the parent is the primary case and the children sometimes to varying degrees adopt the parent's delusional beliefs individuals with this disorder rarely seek treatment and usually are brought to clinical attention when the primary case receives treatment
associated features and disorders
aside from the delusional beliefs behavior is usually not otherwise odd or unusual in shared psychotic disorder impairment is often less severe in the individual with shared psychotic disorder than in the primary case
prevalence
little systematic information about the prevalence of shared psychotic disorder is available this disorder is rare in clinical settings although it has been argued that some cases go unrecognized limited evidence suggests that shared psychotic disorder is somewhat more common in women than in men
306 schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
course
little is known about the age at onset of shared psychotic disorder but it appears to be quite variable without intervention the course is usually chronic because this disorder most commonly occurs in relationships that are long-standing and resistant to change with separation from the primary case the individual's delusional beliefs disappear sometimes quickly and sometimes quite slowly
differential diagnosis
the diagnosis of shared psychotic disorder is made only when the delusion is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition differential diagnosis is rarely a problem because the history of close association with the primary case and the similarity of delusions between the two individuals is unique to shared psychotic disorder in schizophrenia delusional disorder schizoaffec- tive disorder andmood disorder with psychotic features there is either no close relationship with a dominant person who has a psychotic disorder and shares similar delusional beliefs or if there is such a person the psychotic symptoms usually precede the onset of any shared delusions in rare cases an individual may present with what appears to be shared psychotic disorder but the delusions do not disappear when the individual is separated from the primary case in such a situation it is probably appropriate to consider another psychotic disorder diagnosis

psychotic disorder due to a general medicalcondition

the essential features of psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition are prominent hallucinations or delusions that are judged to be due to the direct physiolog- ical effects of a general medical condition criterion a there must be evidence from
psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition 307
the history physical examination or laboratory findings that the delusions or hallucina- tions are the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition criterion b the psychotic disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorderthe symptoms are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe general medical condition in which case a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder with marked stressor would be appropriate criterion c the diagnosis is not made if the disturbance occurs only during the course of a delirium criterion d a separate diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition is not given if delusions occur only during the course of dementia of the alzheimer's type or vascular dementia a diagnosis of dementia of the alzheimer'stype or vasculardementia with the subtype with delusions is given instead
hallucinations can occur in any sensory modality ie visual olfactory gustatory tactile or auditory but certain etiological factors are likely to evoke specific hallucina- tory phenomena olfactory hallucinations especially those involving the smell of burning rubber or other unpleasant smells are highly suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy hallucinations may vary from simple and unformed to highly complex and organized depending on etiological factors environmental surroundings nature and focus of the insult rendered to the central nervous system and the reactive response to impairment psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition is generally not diagnosed if the individual maintains reality testing for the hallucination and appreciates that the perceptual experiences result from the general medical condition delusions may express a variety of themes including somatic grandiose religious and most commonly persecutory religious delusions have been specifically associated in some cases with temporal lobe epilepsy individuals with right parietal brain lesions can develop a contralateral neglect syndrome in which they may disown parts of their body to a delusional extent on the whole however associations between delusions and particular general medical conditions appear to be less specific than is the case for hallucinations
in determining whether the psychotic disturbance is due to a general medical condition the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical condition further the clinician must establish that the psychotic disturbance is etiologically related to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism a careful and comprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the psychotic disturbance and the general medical condition is etiological several considerations provide some guidance in this area one consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset exacerbation or remission of the general medical condition and that of the psychotic disturbance a second consideration is the presence of features that are atypical for a primary psychotic disorderatypical age at onset or presence of visual or olfactory hallucinations evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a direct association between the general medical condition in question and the development of psychotic symptoms can provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation in addition the clinician must also judge that the disturbance is not better accounted for by a primary psychotic disorder a substance-induced psychotic disorder or another primary mental disorderadjust- ment disorder this determination is explained in greater detail in the mental disorders due to a general medical condition section p 165

associated general medical conditions
a variety of general medical conditions may cause psychotic symptoms including neurological conditionsneoplasms cerebrovascular disease huntington's disease epilepsy auditory nerve injury deafness migraine central nervous system infections endocrine conditionshyper- and hypothyroidism hyper- and hypoparathyroidism hypoadrenocorticism metabolic conditionshypoxia hypercarbia hypoglycemia fluid or electrolyte imbalances hepatic or renal diseases and autoimmune disorders with central nervous system involvementsystemic lupus erythematosus those neurological conditions that involve subcortical structures or the temporal lobe are more commonly associated with delusions the associated physical examination findings laboratory findings and patterns of prevalence or onset reflect the etiological general medical condition
differential diagnosis
hallucinations and delusions commonly occur in the context of a delirium however a separate diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium when delusions develop during the course of dementia of the alzheimer's type or vascular dementia a diagnosis of dementia of the alzheimer's type or vascular dementia with the subtype with delusions is given a separate diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition is not given if the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptomspsychotic and anxiety the diagnosis is usually psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition because in such situations psychotic symptoms typically predominate in the clinical picture
psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition 309
if there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use including medications with psychoactive effects withdrawal from a substance or exposure to a toxinlsd intoxication alcohol withdrawal a substance-induced psychotic disorder should be considered it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation symptoms that occur during or shortly after ie within 4 weeks of substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance-induced psychotic disorder depending on the character duration or amount of the substance used if the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a general medical condition and substance u s e  both diagnoses ie psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition and substance- induced psychotic disorder can be given
psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition must be distinguished from a primary psychotic disorderschizophrenia delusional disorder schizoaffec- tive disorder or a primary mood disorder with psychotic features in primary psychotic disorders and in primary mood disorders with psychotic features no specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with a general medical condition can be demonstrated late age at onsetthe first appearance of delusions in an individual over age 35 years and the absence of a personal or family history of schizophrenia or delusional disorder suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition auditory hallucinations that involve voices speaking complex sentences are more characteristic of schizophrenia than of psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition other types of hallucinationsvisual olfactory commonly signal a psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition or a substance-induced psychotic disorder
psychotic disorder not otherwise specified is diagnosed when the clinician cannot determine if the psychotic disturbance is primary substance induced or due to a general medical condition hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations may occur in individuals without a mental disorder but they occur only on falling asleep or on awakening

substance-induced psychotic disorder

the essential features of substance-induced psychotic disorder are prominent halluci- nations or delusions criterion a that are judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance ie a drug of abuse a medication or toxin exposure criterion b hallucinations that the individual realizes are substance induced are not included here and instead would be diagnosed as substance intoxication or substance withdrawal with the accompanying specifier with perceptual disturbances the disturbance must not be better accounted for by a psychotic disorder that is not substance induced criterion c the diagnosis is not made if the psychotic symptoms occur only during the course of a delirium criterion d this diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the psychotic symptoms are in excess of those usually associated with the intoxication or withdrawal syndrome and when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention for a more detailed discussion of substance-related disorders see p 175
a substance-induced psychotic disorder is distinguished from a primary psychotic disorder by considering the onset course and other factors for drugs of abuse there must be evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory findings of intoxication or withdrawal substance-induced psychotic disorders arise only in associ- ation with intoxication or withdrawal states whereas primary psychotic disorders may precede the onset of substance use or may occur during times of sustained abstinence once initiated the psychotic symptoms may continue as long as the substance use continues because the withdrawal state for some substances can be relatively protracted the onset of psychotic symptoms can occur up to 4 weeks after the cessation of substance use another consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of a primary psychotic disorderatypical age at onset or course for example the appearance of delusions de novo in a person over age 35 years without a known history of a primary psychotic disorder should alert the clinician to the possibility of a substance-induced psychotic disorder even a prior history of a primary psychotic disorder does not rule
substance-induced psychotic disorder 311
out the possibility of a substance-induced psychotic disorder it has been suggested that 9 out of 10 nonauditory hallucinations are the product of a substance-induced psychotic disorder or a psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition in contrast factors that suggest that the psychotic symptoms are better accounted for by a primary psychotic disorder include persistence of psychotic symptoms for a substantial period of time ie about a month after the end of substance intoxication or acute substancewithdrawal the development of symptoms that are substantiallyin excess of what would be expected given the type or amount of the substance used or the duration of use or a history of prior recurrent primary psychotic disorders other causes of psychotic symptoms must be considered even in a person with intoxication or withdrawal because substance use problems are not uncommon among persons with presumably non-substance-induced psychotic disorders
subtypes and specifiers
one of the following subtypes may be used to indicate the predominant symptom presentation if both delusions and hallucinations are present code whichever is predominant
with delusions this subtype is used if delusions are the predominant symptom
with hallucinations this subtype is used if hallucinations are the predomi- nant symptom
the context of the development of the psychotic symptoms may be indicated by using one of the specifiers listed below
with onset during intoxication this specifier should be used if criteria for intoxication with the substance are met and the symptoms develop during the intoxication syndrome
with onset during withdrawal this specifier should be used if criteria for withdrawal from the substance are met and the symptoms develop during or shortly after a withdrawal syndrome
recording procedures
the name of the substance-induced psychotic disorder begins with the specific substancecocaine methylphenidate dexamethasone that is presumed to be causing the psychotic symptoms the diagnostic code is selected from the listing of classes of substances provided in the criteria set for substances that do not fit into any of the classesdexamethasone the code for other substance should be used in addition for medications prescribed at therapeutic doses the specific medication can be indicated by listing the appropriate e-code on axis i see appendix g the code for each of the specific substance-induced psychotic disorders depends on whether the presentation is predominated by delusions or hallucinations 29211 for with delusions and 29212 for with hallucinationsexcept for alcohol for which the code is 2915 for with delusions and 2913 for with hallucinations the name of the disordercocaine-induced psychotic disorder methylphenidate-induced psychotic disorder is followed by the subtype indicating the predominant symptom presentation and the specifier indicating the context in which the symptoms developed29211 cocaine-

specific substances
psychotic disorders can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances alcohol amphetamine and related substances cannabis cocaine hallucinogens inhalants opioids meperidine phencyclidine and related substances sedatives hypnotics and anxiolytics and other or unknown substances psychotic disorders can occur in association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances alcohol sedatives hypnotics and anxiolytics and other or unknown substances the initiation of the disorder may vary considerably with the substance for example smoking a high dose of cocaine may produce psychosis within minutes whereas days or weeks of high-dose alcohol or sedative use may be required to produce psychosis hallucinations may occur in any modality in alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations with onset during withdrawal vivid persistent and usually unpleasant hallucinations develop shortly within 48 hours after cessation of or reduction in alcohol ingestion this disorder occurs only after prolonged heavy ingestion of alcohol in people who apparently have alcohol dependence the auditory halluci- nations are usually voices but there may also be visual or tactile hallucinations
the psychotic disorders induced by intoxication with amphetamine and cocaine share similar clinical features persecutory delusions may rapidly develop shortly after use of amphetamine or a similarly acting sympathomimetic distortion of body image and misperception of people's faces may occur the hallucination of bugs or vermin crawling in or under the skin formication can lead to scratching and extensive skin excoriations cannabis-induced psychotic disorder may develop shortly after cannabis use and usually involves persecutory delusions the disorder is apparently rare marked anxiety emotional lability depersonalization and subsequent amnesia for the episode can occur the disorder usually remits within a day but in some cases may persist for a few days hallucinations associated with cannabis intoxication are rare except when very high blood levels are reached
substance-induced psychotic disorders may at times not resolve promptly when the offending agent is removed agents such as amphetamines phencyclidine and cocaine have been reported to evoke temporary psychotic states that can sometimes persist for weeks or longer despite removal of the agent and treatment with neuroleptics these may be initially difficult to distinguish from non-substance-induced psychotic disorders
some of the medications reported to evoke psychotic symptoms include anesthetics and analgesics anticholinergic agents anticonvulsants antihistamines antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications antimicrobial medications antiparkinsonian medica- tions chemotherapeutic agentscyclosporine and procarbazine corticosteroids gastrointestinal medications muscle relaxants nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medica- tions other over-the-counter medicationsphenylephrine pseudoephedrine
substance-induced psychotic disorder 313
antidepressant medication and disulfiram toxins reported to induce psychotic symp- toms include anticholinesterase organophosphate insecticides nerve gases carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and volatile substances such as fuel or paint
differential diagnosis
a diagnosis of substance-induced psychotic disorder should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the psychotic symptoms are judged to be in excess of those usually associated with the intoxication or withdrawal syndrome and when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention individualsintoxicated with stimulantscannabis the opioid meperidine or phencyclidine or those withdrawing from alcohol or sedatives may experience altered perceptions scintillating lights sounds visual illusions that they recognize as drug effects if reality testing for these experiences remains intact ie the person recognizes that the perception is substance induced and neither believes in nor acts on it the diagnosis is not substance-induced psychotic disorder instead sub- stance intoxication or withdrawalwith perceptual disturbances is diagnosedcocaine intoxication with perceptual disturbances flashback hallucination that can occur long after the use of hallucinogens has stopped are diagnosed as hallucinogen persisting perception disorder see p 233 moreover if substance induced psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium as in some severe forms of alcohol withdrawal the psychotic symptoms are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately
a substance-induced psychotic disorder is distinguished from a primary psychotic disorder by the fact that a substance is judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms see p 310
a substance-induced psychotic disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental or general medical condition must have its onset while the person is receiving the medication or during withdrawal if there is a withdrawal syndrome associated 'with the medication once the treatment is discontinued the psychotic symptoms will usually remit within days to several weeks depending on the half-life of the substance and the presence of a withdrawal syndrome if symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks other causes for the psychotic symptoms should be considered because individuals with general medical conditions often take medications for those conditions the clinician must consider the possibility that the psychotic symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the general medical condition rather than the medication in which case psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition is diagnosed the history often provides the primary basis for such a judgment at times a change in the treatment for the general medical conditionmedication substitution or discontin- uation may be needed to determine empiricallyfor that person whether the medication is the causative agent if the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a general medical condition and substance useboth diagnoses ie psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition and substance-induced psychotic disorder may be given when there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the psychotic symptoms are due to a substance including a medication or to a general medical condition or are primary ie not due to either a substance or a general medical condition psychotic disorder not otherwise specified would be indicated

mood disorders
the mood disorders section includes disorders that have a disturbance in mood as the predominant feature the section is divided into three parts the first part describes mood episodes major depressive episode manic episode mixed episode
and hypomanic episode that have been included separately at the beginning of this section for convenience in diagnosing the various mood disorders these episodes do not have their own diagnostic codes and cannot be diagnosed as separate entities however they serve as the building blocks for the disorder diagnoses the second part describes the mood disordersmajor depressive disorder dysthymic disorder bipolar i disorder the criteria sets for most of the mood disorders require the presence or absence of the mood episodes described in the first part of the section the third part includes the specifiers that describe either the most recent mood episode or the course of recurrent episodes
the mood disorders are divided into the depressive disorders unipolar depres- sion the bipolar disorders and two disorders based on etiologyâ€”mood disorder due to a general medical condition and substance-induced mood disorder the depressive disorders ie major depressive disorder dysthymic disorder and depressive disorder not otherwise specified are distinguished from the bipolar disorders by the fact that there is no history of ever having had a manic mixed or hypomanic episode the bipolar disorders ie bipolar i disorder bipolar ii disorder cyclothymic disorder and bipolar disorder not otherwise specified involve the presence or history of manic episodes mixed episodes or hypomanic episodes usually accompanied by the presence or history of major depressive episodes
major depressive disorder is characterized by one or more major depressive episodes ie at least 2 weeks of depressed mood or loss of interest accompanied by at least four additional symptoms of depression
dysthymic disorder is characterized by at least 2 years of depressed mood for more days than notaccompanied by additional depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode
depressive disorder not otherwise specified is included for coding disorders with depressive features that do not meet criteria for major depressive disorder dysthymic disorder adjustment disorder with depressed mood or adjustment disor- der with mixed anxiety and depressed mood or depressive symptoms about which there is inadequate or contradictoryinformationbipolar i disorder is characterized by one or more manic or mixed episodes usually accompanied by major depressive episodes317
318 mood disorders
bipolar ii disorder is characterized by one or more major depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode
cyclothymic disorder is characterized by at least 2 years of numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a manic episode and numerous periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode
bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is included for coding disorders with bipolar features that do not meet criteria for any of the specific bipolar disorders defined in this section or bipolar symptoms about which there is inadequate or contradictory information
mood disorder due to a general medical condition is characterized by a prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that is judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition
substance-induced mood disorder is characterized by a prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that is judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a drug of abuse a medication another somatic treatment for depression or toxin exposure
mood disorder not otherwise specified is included for coding disorders with mood symptoms that do not meet the criteria for any specific mood disorder and in which it is difficult to choose between depressive disorder not otherwise specified and bipolar disorder not otherwise specifiedacute agitation
the specifiers described in the third part of the section are provided to increase diagnostic specificity create more homogeneous subgroups assist in treatment selection and improve the prediction of prognosis some of the specifiers describe the current or most recent mood episode ie severity/psychotic/remission chronic with catatonic features with melancholic features with atypical features with postpartum onset table 1 p 376 indicates which episode specifiers apply to each codable mood disorder other specifiers describe the course of recurrent mood episodes ie longitudinal course specifiers with seasonal pattern with rapid cycling table 2 p 388 indicates which course specifiers apply to each codable mood disorder the specifiers that indicate severity remission and psychotic features can be coded in the fifth digit of the diagnostic code for most of the mood disorders the other specifiers cannot be coded

major depressive episode
the essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least 2 weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities in children and adolescents the mood may be irritable rather than sad the individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list that includes changes in appetite or weight sleep and psychomotor activity decreased energy feelings of worthlessness or guilt difficulty thinking concentrating or making decisions or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation plans or attempts to count toward a major depressive episode a symptom must either be newly present or must have clearly worsened compared with the person's preepisode status the symptoms must persist for most of the day nearly every day for at least 2 consecutive weeks the episode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning for some individuals with milder episodes functioning may appear to be normal but requires markedly increased effort
the mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person as depressed sad hopeless discouraged or down in the dumps criterion al in some cases sadness may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interviewby pointing out that the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry in some individuals who complain of feeling blah having no feelings or feeling anxious the
presence of a depressed mood can be inferred from the person's facial expression and demeanor some individuals emphasize somatic complaintsbodily aches and pains rather than reporting feelings of sadness many individuals report or exhibit increased irritabilitypersistent anger a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others or an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters in children and adolescents an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood this presentation should be differentiated from a spoiled child pattern of irritability when frustrated
loss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present at least to some degree individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies not caring anymore or not feeling any enjoyment in activitiesthat were previously considered pleasurablecriterion a2 family members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocationsa formerly avid golfer no longer plays a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to practice in some individuals there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire
appetite is usually reduced and many individuals feel that they have to force themselves to eat other individuals particularly those encountered in ambulatory settings may have increased appetite and may crave specific foodssweets or other carbohydrates when appetite changes are severe in either direction there may be a significant loss or gain in weight or in children a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted criterion a3
the most common sleep disturbance associated with a major depressive episode is insomnia criterion a4 individuals typically have middle insomnia ie waking up during the night and having difficulty returning to sleep or terminal insomnia ie waking too early and being unable to return to sleep initial insomnia ie difficulty falling asleep may also occur less frequently individuals present with oversleeping hypersomnia in the form of prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the disturbed sleep
psychomotor changes include agitationthe inability to sit still pacing hand-wringing or pulling or rubbing of the skin clothing or other objects or retardationslowed speech thinking and body movements increased pauses before answer- ing speech that is decreased in volume inflection amount or variety of content or muteness criterion a5 the psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe enough to be observable by others and not represent merely subjective feelings
decreased energy tiredness and fatigue are common criterion a6 a person may report sustained fatigue without physical exertion even the smallest tasks seem to require substantial effort the efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced for example an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are exhausting and take twice as long as usual
the sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may include unrealistic negative evaluations of one's worth or guilty preoccupations or ruminations over minor past failings criterion a7 such individuals often misinterpret neutral or trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense of responsibility for untoward events for example a realtor may become preoccupied with self-blame for failing to make sales even when the market has collapsed generally and other realtors are equally unable to make sales the sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delusional proportionsan individual who is convinced that he or she is personally responsible for world poverty blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet occupational or interpersonal responsibilities as amajor depressive episode 321
322 mood disorders
result of the depression is very common and unless delusional is not considered sufficient to meet this criterion
many individuals report impaired ability to think concentrate or make decisions criterion a8 they may appear easily distracted or complain of memory difficulties those in intellectually demanding academic or occupational pursuits are often unable to function adequately even when they have mild concentration problemsa computer programmer who can no longer perform complicated but previously manage- able tasks in children a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration in elderly individuals with a major depressive episode memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs of a dementia pseudodementia when the major depressive episode is successfully treated the memory problems often fully abate however in some individuals particularly elderly persons a major depres sive episode may sometimes be the initial presentation of an irreversible dementia
frequently there may be thoughts of death suicidal ideation or suicide attempts criterion a9 these thoughts range from a belief that others would be better off if the person were dead to transient but recurrent thoughts of committing suicide to actual specific plans of how to commit suicide the frequency intensity and lethality of these thoughts can be quite variable less severely suicidal individuals may report transient 1- to 2-minute recurrent once or twice a week thoughts more severely suicidal individuals may have acquired materialsa rope or a gun to be used in the suicide attempt and may have established a location and time when they will be isolated from others so that they can accomplish the suicide although these behaviors are associated statistically with suicide attempts and may be helpful in identifying a high-risk group many studies have shown that it is not possible to predict accurately whether or when a particular individual with depression will attempt suicide motivations for suicide may include a desire to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles or an intense wish to end an excruciatingly painful emotional state that is perceived by the person to be without end
a diagnosis of a major depressive episode is not made if the symptoms meet criteria for a mixed episode criterion b a mixed episode is characterized by the symptoms of both a manic episode and a major depressive episode occurring nearly every day for at least a 1-week period
the degree of impairment associated with a major depressive episode varies but even in mild cases there must be either clinicallysignificant distress or some interference in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion c if impairment is severe the person may lose the ability to function socially or occupation- ally in extreme cases the person may be unable to perform minimal self-carefeeding or clothing self or to maintain minimal personal hygiene
a careful interview is essential to elicit symptoms of a major depressive episode reporting may be compromised by difficulties in concentrating impaired memory or a tendency to deny discount or explain away symptoms information from additional informants can be especially helpful in clarifying the course of current or prior major depressive episodes and in assessing whether there have been any manic or hypomanic episodes because major depressive episodes can begin gradually a review of clinical information that focuses on the worst part of the current episode may be most likely to detect the presence of symptoms the evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult when they occur in an individual who also has a general medical conditioncancer stroke myocardial infarction diabetes some of the criterion items of a major depressive episode are identical to the characteristic signs and
symptoms of general medical conditionsweight loss with untreated diabetes fatigue with cancer such symptoms should count toward a major depressive episode except when they are clearly and fully accounted for by a general medical condition for example weight loss in a person with ulcerative colitis who has many bowel movements and little food intake should not be counted toward a major depressive episode on the other hand when sadness guilt insomnia or weight loss are present in a person with a recent myocardial infarction each symptom would count toward a major depressive episode because these are not clearly and fully accounted for by the physiological effects of a myocardial infarction similarly when symptoms are clearly due to mood-incongruent delusions or hallucinationsa 30-pound weight loss related to not eating because of a delusion that one's food is being poisoned these symptoms do not count toward a major depressive episode
by definition a major depressive episode is not due to the direct physiological effects of a drug of abusein the context of alcohol intoxication or cocaine withdrawal to the side effects of medications or treatmentssteroids or to toxin exposure similarly the episode is not due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical conditionhypothyroidism criterion d moreover if the symptoms begin within 2 months of the loss of a loved one and do not persist beyond these 2 months they are generally considered to result from bereavement see p 684 unless they are associated with marked functional impairment or include morbid preoccupation with worthlessness suicidal ideation psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation criterion e
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders individuals with a major depressive episode frequently present with tearfulness irritability brooding obsessive rumination anxiety phobias excessive worry over physical health and complaints of painheadaches or joint abdominal or other pains during a major depressive episode some individuals have panic attacks that occur in a pattern that meets criteria for panic disorder in children separation anxiety may occur some individuals note difficulty in intimate relationships less satisfying social interactions or difficulties in sexual functioninganorgasmia in women or erectile dysfunction in men there may be marital problemsdivorce occupational problemsloss of job academic problemstruancy school failure alcohol or other substance abuse or increased utilization of medical services the most serious consequence of a major depressive episode is attempted or completed suicide suicide risk is especially high for individuals with psychotic features a history of previous suicide attempts a family history of completed suicides or concurrent substance use there may also be an increased rate of premature death from general medical conditions major depressive episodes often follow psychosocial stressorsthe death of a loved one marital separation divorce childbirth may precipitate a major depressive episode in which case the specifier with postpartum onset is noted see p 386
associated laboratory findings no laboratory findings that are diagnostic of a major depressive episode have been identified however a variety of laboratory findings have been noted to be abnormal in groups of individualswith major depressive episodes compared with control subjects it appears that the same laboratory abnormalities aremajor depressive episode 323
324 mood disorders
associated with a major depressive episode regardless of whether the episode is part of a major depressive bipolar i or bipolar ii disorder most laboratory abnormalities are state dependent ie affected by the presence or absence of depressive symptoms but some findings may precede the onset of the episode or persist after its remission laboratory tests are more likely to be abnormal in episodes with melancholic or psychotic features and in more severely depressed individuals
sleep eeg abnormalities may be evident in 40%-60% of outpatients and in up to 90% of inpatients with a major depressive episode the most frequently associated polysomnographic findings include 1 sleep continuity disturbances such as prolonged sleep latency increased intermittent wakefulness and early morning awakening 2 reduced nonâ€”rapid eye movement nrem stages 3 and 4 sleep slow-wave sleep with a shift in slow-wave activity away from the first nrem period 3 decreased rapid eye movement rem latency ie shortened duration of the first nrem period 4 increased phasic rem activity ie the number of actual eye movements during rem and 5 increased duration of remsleep early in the night some evidence suggests that these sleep abnormalities may sometimes persist after clinical remission or may precede the onset of the initial major depressive episode
neurotransmitters implicated in the pathophysiology of a major depressive episode include norepinephrine serotonin acetylcholine dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid evidence that implicates these neurotransmitters includes measures of their levels in blood cerebrospinal fluid or urine and platelet receptor functioning other laboratory tests that have demonstrated abnormalities include the dexamethasone suppression test other neuroendocrine challenges functional and structural brain imaging evoked potentials and waking eeg
specific culture age and gender features
culture can influence the experience and communication of symptoms of depression underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis can be reduced by being alert to ethnic and cultural specificity in the presenting complaints of a major depressive episode for example in some cultures depression may be experienced largely in somatic terms rather than with sadness or guilt complaints of nerves and headaches in latino and mediterranean cultures of weakness tiredness or imbalance in chinese and asian cultures of problems of the heart in middle eastern cultures or of being heartbroken among hopi may express the depressive experience such presentations combine features of the depressive anxiety and somatoform disorders cultures also may differ in judgments about the seriousness of experiencing or expressing dysphoriairritability may provoke greater concern than sadness or withdrawal culturally distinctive experiencesfear of being hexed or bewitched feelings of heat in the head or crawling sensations of worms or ants or vivid feelings of being visited by those who have died must be distinguished from actual hallucinations or delusions that may be part of a major depressive episode with psychotic features it is also imperative that the clinician not routinely dismiss a symptom merely because it is viewed as the norm for a culture
the core symptoms of a major depressive episode are the same for children and adolescents although there are data that suggest that the prominence of characteristic symptoms may change with age certain symptoms such as somatic complaints irritability and social withdrawal are particularly common in children whereas psycho-
motor retardation hypersomnia and delusions are less common in prepuberty than in adolescence and adulthood in prepubertal children major depressive episodes occur more frequently in conjunction with other mental disorders especially disruptive behavior disorders attention-deficit disorders and anxiety disorders than in isolation in adolescents major depressive episodes are frequently associated with disruptive behavior disorders attention-deficit disorders anxiety disorders substance-related disorders and eating disorders in elderly adults cognitive symptomsdisorienta- tion memory loss and distractibility may be particularlyprominent
a significant proportion of women report a worsening of the symptoms of a major depressive episode several days before the onset of menses studies indicate that depressive episodes occur twice as frequently in women as in men see the correspond- ing sections of the texts for major depressive disorder p 341 bipolar i disorder p 352 and bipolar ii disorder p 360 for specific information on gender
course
symptoms of a major depressive episode usually develop over days to weeks a prodromal period that may include anxiety symptoms and mild depressive symptoms may last for weeks to months before the onset of a full major depressive episode the duration of a major depressive episode is also variable an untreated episode typically lasts 6 months or longer regardless of age at onset in a majority of cases there is complete remission of symptoms and functioning returns to the premorbid level in a significant proportion of cases perhaps 20%-30% some depressive symptoms insuffi- cient to meet full criteria for a major depressive episode may persist for months to years and may be associated with some disability or distress in which case the specifier in partial remission may be noted p 377 partial remission following a major depressive episode appears to be predictive of a similar pattern after subsequent episodes in some individuals 5%-10% the full criteria for a major depressive episode continue to be met for 2 or more years in which case the specifier chronic may be noted see p382

a major depressive episode must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition the appropriate diagnosis would be mood disorder due to a general medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical conditionmultiple sclerosis stroke hypothyroidism see p 366 this determination is based on the history laboratory findings or physical examination if both a major depressive episode and a general medical condition are present but it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition then the primary mood disorder is recorded on axis imajor depressive disorder and the general medical condition is recorded on axis iiimyocardial infarction this would be the case for example if the major depressive episode is considered to be the psychological consequence of having the general medical condition or if there is no etiological relationship between the major depressive episode and the general medical condition
a substance-induced mood disorder is distinguished from a major depressive episode by the fact that a substancea drug of abuse a medication or a toxin ismajor depressive episode 325
326 mood disorders
judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance see p 370 for example depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced mood disorder with depressive features with onset during withdrawal
in elderly persons it is often difficult to determine whether cognitive symptomsdisorientation apathy difficulty concentrating memory loss are better accounted for by a dementia or by a major depressive episode a thorough medical evaluation and an evaluation of the onset of the disturbance temporal sequencing of depressive and cognitive symptoms course of illness and treatment response are helpful in making this determination the premorbid state of the individual may help to differentiate a major depressive episode from a dementia in a dementia there is usually a premorbid history of declining cognitive function whereas the individual with a major depressive episode is much more likely to have a relatively normal premorbid state and abrupt cognitive decline associated with the depression
major depressive episodes with prominent irritable mood may be difficult to distinguish from manic episodes with irritable mood or from mixed episodes this distinction requires a careful clinical evaluation of the presence of manic symptoms if criteria are met for both a manic episode and a major depressive episode except for the 2-week duration nearly every day for at least a 1-week period this would constitute a mixed episode
distractibility and low frustration tolerance can occur in both attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and a major depressive episode if the criteria are met for both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be diagnosed in addition to the mood disorder however the clinician must be cautious not to overdiagnose a major depressive episode in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder whose disturbance in mood is characterized by irritability rather than by sadness or loss of interest
a major depressive episode that occurs in response to a psychosocial stressor is distinguished from adjustment disorder with depressed mood by the fact that the full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met in adjustment disorder after the loss of a loved one even if depressive symptoms are of sufficient duration and number to meet criteria for a major depressive episode they should be attributed to bereavement rather than to a major depressive episode unless they persist for more than 2 months or include marked functional impairment morbid preoccupation with worthlessness suicidal ideation psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation
finally periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human experience these periods should not be diagnosed as a major depressive episode unless criteria are met for severity ie five out of nine symptoms duration ie most of the day nearly every day for at least 2 weeks and clinically significant distress or impairment the diagnosis depressive disorder not otherwise specified may be appropriate for presentations of depressed mood with clinically significant impairment that do not meet criteria for duration or severity
criteria for major depressive episode
a five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning at least one of the symptoms is either 1 depressed mood or 2 loss of interest or pleasure
note do not include symptoms that are clearly due to a general medical condition or mood-incongruent delusions orhallucinations
1 depressed mood most of the day nearly every day as indicated by either subjective reportfeels sad or empty or observation made by othersappears tearful note in children and adolescents can be irritable mood
2 markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities most of the day nearly every day as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others
3 significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gaina change of more than 5% of body weight in a month or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day note in children consider failure to make expected weight gains
4 insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day
5 psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day observable
by others not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being
slowed down
6 fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day
7 feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt which
may be delusional nearly every day not merely self-reproach or
guilt about being sick
8 diminished abilityto think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly
every day either by subjective account or as observed by others
9 recurrent thoughts of death not just fear of dying recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan or a suicide attempt or a
specific plan for committing suicide
b the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode see p 335
c the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning
d the symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substancea drug of abuse a medication or a general medical conditionhypothyroidism
e the symptoms are not better accounted for by bereavement ie after the loss of a loved one the symptoms persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment morbid preoc- cupation with worthlessness suicidal ideation psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardationmajor depressive episode 327

episode features
manic episode
a manic episode is defined by a distinct period during which there is an abnormally and persistently elevated expansive or irritable mood this period of abnormal mood must last at least 1 week or less if hospitalization is required criterion a the mood disturbance must be accompanied by at least three additional symptoms from a list that includes inflated self-esteem or grandiosity decreased need for sleep pressure of speech flight of ideas distractibility increased involvement in goal-directed activities or psycho motor agitation and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities with a high potential for painful consequences if the mood is irritable rather than elevated or expansive at least four of the above symptoms must be present criterion b the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode which is characterized by the symptoms of both a manic episode and a major depressive episode occurring nearly every day for at least a 1-week period criterion c the disturbance must be sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalization or it is characterized by the presence of psychotic features criterion d the episode must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a drug of abuse a medication other somatic treatments for depressionelectroconvulsive therapy or light therapy or toxin exposure the episode must also not be due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical conditionmultiple sclerosis brain tumor criterion e
the elevated mood of a manic episode may be described as euphoric unusually good cheerful or high although the person's mood may initially have an infectious quality for the uninvolved observer it is recognized as excessive by those who know the person well the expansive quality of the mood is characterized by unceasing and indiscriminate enthusiasm for interpersonal sexual or occupational interactions for example the person may spontaneously start extensive conversations with strangers in public places or a salesperson may telephone strangers at home in the early morning hours to initiate sales although elevated mood is considered the prototypical symptom the predominant mood disturbance may be irritability particularly when the person's wishes are thwarted lability of moodthe alternation between euphoria and irritability is frequently seen
inflated self-esteem is typically present ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked grandiosity and may reach delusional proportions criterion bl individuals may give advice on matters about which they have no special knowledgehow to run the united nations despite lack of any particular experience or talent the individual may embark on writing a novel or composing a symphony or seek publicity for some impractical invention grandiose delusions are commonhaving a special relation- ship to god or to some public figure from the political religious or entertainment world
almost invariably there is a decreased need for sleep criterion b2 the person usually awakens several hours earlier than usual feeling full of energy when the sleep disturbance is severe the person may go for days without sleep and yet not feel tired
manic speech is typically pressured loud rapid and difficult to interrupt criterion b3 individuals may talk nonstop sometimes for hours on end and without regard for others' wishes to communicate speech is sometimes characterized by joking punning and amusing irrelevancies the individual may become theatrical with dramatic mannerisms and singing sounds rather than meaningful conceptual relationships may govern word choice ie clanging if the person's mood is more irritablethan expansive

speech may be marked by complaints hostile comments or angry tirades
the individual's thoughts may race often at a rate faster than can be articulated criterion b4 some individuals with manic episodes report that this experience resembles watching two or three television programs simultaneously frequently there is flight of ideas evidenced by a nearly continuous flow of accelerated speech with abrupt changes from one topic to another for example while talking about a potential business deal to sell computers a salesperson may shift to discussing in minute detail the history of the computer chip the industrial revolution or applied mathematics when
flight of ideas is severe speech may become disorganized and incoherent distractibility criterion b5 is evidenced by an inability to screen out irrelevant external stimulithe interviewer's tie background noises or conversations or furnishings in the room there may be a reduced ability to differentiate between thoughts that are germane to the topic and thoughts that are only slightly relevant or
clearly irrelevant
the increase in goal-directed activity often involves excessive planning of and
excessive participation in multiple activitiessexual occupational political reli- gious criterion b6 increased sexual drive fantasies and behavior are often present the person may simultaneously take on multiple new business ventures without regard for the apparent risks or the need to complete each venture satisfactorily almost invariably there is increased sociabilityrenewing old acquaintances or calling friends or even strangers at all hours of the day or night without regard to the intrusive domineering and demanding nature of these interactions individuals often display psychomotor agitation or restlessness by pacing or by holding multiple conversations simultaneouslyby telephone and in person at the same time some individuals write a torrent of letters on many different topics to friends public figures or the media
expansiveness unwarranted optimism grandiosity and poor judgment often lead to an imprudent involvement in pleasurable activities such as buying sprees reckless driving foolish business investments and sexual behavior unusual for the person even though these activities are likely to have painful consequences criterion b7 the individual may purchase many unneeded items20 pairs of shoes expensive antiques without the money to pay for them unusual sexual behavior may include infidelity or indiscriminate sexual encounters with strangers
the impairment resulting from the disturbance must be severe enough to cause marked impairment in functioning or to require hospitalization to protect the individual from the negative consequences of actions that result from poor judgmentfinancial losses illegal activities loss of employment assaultive behavior by definition the presence of psychotic features during a manic episode constitutes marked impairment in functioning criterion d
symptoms like those seen in a manic episode may be due to the direct effects of antidepressant medication electroconvulsive therapy light therapy or medication prescribed for other general medical conditionscorticosteroids such presentations are not considered manic episodes and do not count toward the diagnosis of bipolar i disorder for example if a person with recurrent major depressive disorder develops manic symptoms following a course of antidepressant medication the episode is diagnosed as a substance-induced mood disorder with manic features and there is no switch from a diagnosis of major depressive disorder to bipolar i disorder some evidence suggests that there may be a bipolar diathesis in individuals who develop manic-like episodes following somatic treatment for depression such individuals may have an increased likelihood of future manic mixed or hypomanic episodes that aremanic episode 329
330 mood disorders
not related to substances or somatic treatments for depression this may be an especially important consideration in children and adolescents
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders individuals with a manic episode frequently do not recognize that they are ill and resist efforts to be treated they may travel impulsively to other cities losing contact with relatives and caretakers they may change their dress makeup or personal appearance to a more sexually suggestive or dramatically flamboyant style that is out of character for them they may engage in activities that have a disorganized or bizarre qualitydistributing candy money or advice to passing strangers gambling and antisocial behaviors may accompany the manic episode ethical concerns may be disregarded even by those who are typically very conscientiousa stockbroker inappropriately buys and sells stock without the clients' knowledge or permission a scientist incorporates the findings of others the person may be hostile and physically threatening to others some individuals especially those with psychotic features may become physically assaultive or suicidal adverse consequences of a manic episodeinvoluntary hospitalization difficulties with the law or serious financial difficulties often result from poor judgment and hyperactivity when no longer in the manic episode most individuals are regretful for behaviors engaged in during the manic episode some individuals describe having a much sharper sense of smell hearing or visioncolors appear very bright when catatonic symptomsstupor mutism negativism and posturing are present the specifier with catatonic features may be indicated see p 382
mood may shift rapidly to anger or depression depressive symptoms may last moments hours or more rarely days not uncommonly the depressive symptoms and manic symptoms occur simultaneously if the criteria for both a major depressive episode and a manic episode are prominent every day for at least 1 week the episode is considered to be a mixed episode see p 333 as the manic episode develops there is often a substantial increase in the use of alcohol or stimulants which may exacerbate or prolong the episode
associated laboratory findings no laboratory findings that are diagnostic of a manic episode have been identified however a variety of laboratory findings have been noted to be abnormal in groups of individuals with manic episodes compared with control subjects laboratory findings in manic episodes include polysomnographic abnormalities increased cortisol secretion and absence of dexamethasone nonsuppres- sion there may be abnormalities involving the norepinephrine serotonin acetylcholine dopamine or gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter systems as demonstrated by studies of neurotransmitter metabolites receptor functioning pharmacological provoca- tion and neuroendocrine function
specific culture age and gender features
cultural considerations that were suggested for major depressive episodes are also relevant to manic episodes see p 324 manic episodes in adolescents are more likel to include psychotic features and may be associated with school truancy antisocial behavior school failure or substance usea significant minority of adolescents appear
to have a history of long-standing behavior problems that precede the onset of a frank manic episode it is unclear whether these problems represent a prolonged prodrome to bipolar disorder or an independent disorder see the corresponding sections of the texts for bipolar i disorder p 352 and bipolar ii disorder p 360 for specific information on gender
course
the mean age at onset for a first manic episode is the early 20s but some cases start in adolescence and others start after age 50years manic episodes typicallybegin suddenly with a rapid escalation of symptoms over a few days frequently manic episodes occur following psychosocial stressors the episodes usually last from a few weeks to several months and are briefer and end more abruptly than major depressive episodes in many instances 50%-60% a major depressive episode immediately precedes or immediately follows a manic episode with no intervening period of euthymia if the manic episode occurs in the postpartum period there may be an increased risk for recurrence in subsequent postpartum periods and the specifier with postpartum onset is applicable see p 386
differential diagnosis
a manic episode must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition the appropriate diagnosis would be mood disorder due to a general medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physio- logical consequence of a specific general medical conditionmultiple sclerosis brain tumor cushing's syndrome see p 366 this determination is based on the history laboratory findings or physical examination if it is judged that the manic symptoms are not the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition then the primary mood disorder is recorded on axis ibipolar i disorder and the general medical condition is recorded on axis iiimyocardial infarction a late onset of a first manic episodeafter age 50 years should alert the clinician to the possibility of an etiological general medical condition or substance
a substance-induced mood disorder is distinguished from a manic episode by the fact that a substancea drug of abuse a medication or exposure to a toxin is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance see p 370 symptoms like those seen in a manic episode may be precipitated by a drug of abusemanic symptoms that occur only in the context of intoxication with cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced mood disorder with manic features with onset during intoxica- tion symptoms like those seen in a manic episode may also be precipitated by antidepressant treatment such as medication electroconvulsive therapy or light therapy such episodes are also diagnosed as substance-induced mood disordersamitrip- tyline-induced mood disorder with manic features electroconvulsive therapy- induced mood disorder with manic features
manic episodes should be distinguished from hypomanic episodes although manic episodes and hypomanic episodes have an identical list of characteristic symptoms the disturbance in hypomanic episodes is not sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalization some hypomanic episodes may evolve into full manic episodesmajor depressive episodes with prominent irritable mood may be difficult tomanic episode 331

episode features
mixed episode
a mixed episode is characterized by a period of time lasting at least 1 week in which the criteria are met both for a manic episode and for a major depressive episode nearly every day criterion a the individual experiences rapidly alternating moods sadness irritability euphoria accompanied by symptoms of a manic episode see p 328 and a major depressive episode see p 320 the symptom presentation frequently includes agitation insomnia appetite dysregulation psychotic features and suicidal thinking the disturbance must be sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalization or it is characterized by the presence of psychotic features criterion b the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substancea drug of abuse a medication or other treatment or a general medical conditionhyperthyroidism criterion c symp- toms like those seen in a mixed episode may be due to the direct effects of antidepressant medication electroconvulsive therapy light therapy or medication prescribed for other general medical conditionscorticosteroids such presentations are not considered mixed episodes and do not count toward a diagnosis of bipolar i disorder for example if a person with recurrent major depressive disorder develops a mixed symptom picture during a course of antidepressant medication the diagnosis of the episode is substance- induced mood disorder with mixed features and there is no switch from a diagnosis of major depressive disorder to bipolar i disorder some evidence suggests that there may be a bipolar diathesis in individuals who develop mixed-like episodes following somatic treatment for depression such individuals may have an increased likelihood of future manic mixed or hypomanic episodes that are not related to substances or somatic treatments for depression this may be an especially important consideration in children and adolescents
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders associated features of a mixed episode are similar to those for manic episodes and major depressive episodes individuals may be disorganized in their thinking or behavior because individuals in mixed episodes experience more dysphoria than do those in manic episodes they may be more likely to seek help
associated laboratory findings laboratoryfindings for mixedepisode are not well studied although evidence to date suggests physiological and endocrine findings that are similar to those found in severe major depressive episodes
specific culture age and gender features
cultural considerations suggested for major depressive episodes are relevant to mixed episodes as well see p 324 mixed episodes appear to be more common in younger individuals and in individuals over age 60 years with bipolar disorder and may be more common in males than in femalesmixed episode 333
334 mood disorders
course
mixed episodes can evolve from a manic episode or from a major depressive episode or may arise de novo for example the diagnosis would be changed from bipolar i disorder most recent episode manic to bipolar i disorder most recent episode mixed for an individual with 3 weeks of manic symptoms followed by 1 week of both manic symptoms and depressive symptoms mixed episodes may last weeks to several months and may remit to a period with few or no symptoms or evolve into a major depressive episode it is far less common for a mixed episode to evolve into a manic episode
differential diagnosis
a mixed episode must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition the diagnosis is mood disorder due to a general medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical conditionmultiple sclerosis brain tumor cushing's syndrome see p 366 this determination is based on the history laboratory findings or physical examination if it is judged that the mixed manic and depressive symptoms are not the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition then the primary mood disorder is recorded on axis ibipolar i disorder and the general medical condition is recorded on axis iiimyocardial infarction
a substance-induced mood disorder is distinguished from a mixed episode by the fact that a substancea drug of abuse a medication or exposure to a toxin is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance see p 370symptoms like those seen in a mixed episode may be precipitated by use of a drug of abusemixed manic and depressive symptoms that occur only in the context of intoxication with cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced mood disorder with mixed features with onset during intoxication symptoms like those seen in a mixed episode may also be precipitated by antidepressant treatment such as medication electro- convulsive therapy or light therapy such episodes are also diagnosed as substance- induced mood disordersamitriptyline-induced mood disorder with mixed features electroconvulsive therapy-induced mood disorder with mixed features

episode features
a hypomanic episode is defined as a distinct period during which there is an abnormally and persistently elevated expansive or irritable mood that lasts at least 4 days criterion a this period of abnormal mood must be accompanied by at least three additional symptoms from a list that includes inflated self-esteem or grandiosity nondelusional decreased need for sleep pressure of speech flight of ideas distract- ibility increased involvement in goal-directed activities or psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences criterion b if the mood is irritable rather than elevated or expansive at least four of the above symptoms must be present this list of additional symptoms is identical to those that define a manic episode see p 328 except that delusions or hallucinations cannot be present the mood during a hypomanic episode must be clearly different from the individual's usual nondepressed mood and there must be a clear change in functioning that is not characteristic of the individual's usual functioning criterion c because the changes in mood and functioning must be observable by others criterion d the evaluation of this criterion will often require interviewing other informantsfamily members history from other informants is particularly important in the evaluation of adolescents in contrast to a manic episode a hypomanic episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalization and there are no psychotic features criterion e the change in functioning for some individuals may take the form of a marked increase in efficiency accomplishments or creativity however for others hypomania can cause some social or occupational impairmentthe mood disturbance and other symptoms must not be due to the directhypomanic episode 335

specific culture and age features
cultural considerations that were suggested for major depressive episodes are relevant to hypomanic episodes as well see p 324 in youngeradolescent persons hypomanic episodes may be associated with school truancy antisocial behavior school failure or substance use
course
a hypomanic episode typically begins suddenly with a rapid escalation of symptoms within a day or two episodes may last for several weeks to months and are usually more abrupt in onset and briefer than major depressive episodes in many cases the hypomanic episode may be preceded or followed by a major depressive episode studies suggest that 5%-15% of individuals with hypomania will ultimately develop a manic episode

major depressive disorder

the essential feature of major depressive disorder is a clinical course that is character- ized by one or more major depressive episodes see p 320 without a history of manic mixed or hypomanic episodes criteria a and c episodes of substance-induced mood disorder due to the direct physiological effects of a drug of abuse a medication or toxin exposure or of mood disorder due to a general medical condition do not count toward a diagnosis of major depressive disorder in addition the episodes must not be better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and are not superimposed on schizo- phrenia schizophreniform disorder delusional disorder or psychotic disorder not otherwise specifiedcriterionb
the fourth digit in the diagnostic code for major depressive disorder indicates whether it is a single episode used only for first episodes or recurrent it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between a single episode with waxing and waning symptoms and two separate episodes for purposes of this manual an episode is considered to have ended when the full criteria for the major depressive episode have not been met for at least 2 consecutive months during this 2-month period there is either complete resolution of symptoms or the presence of depressive symptoms that no longer meet the full criteria for a major depressive episode in partial remission
the fifth digit in the diagnostic code for major depressive disorder indicates the current state of the disturbance if the criteria for a major depressive episode are met the severity of the episode is noted as mild moderate severe without psychoticfeatures or severe with psychotic features if the criteria for a major depressive episode are not currently met the fifth digit is used to indicate whether the disorder is in partial remission or in full remission see p 377
if manic mixed or hypomanic episodes develop in the course of major depressive disorder the diagnosis is changed to a bipolar disorder however if manic or hypomanic symptoms occur as a direct effect of antidepressant treatment use of other medications substance use or toxin exposure the diagnosis of major depressive disorder remains appropriate and an additional diagnosis of substance-induced mood disorder with manic features or with mixed features should be noted similarly if manic or hypomanic symptoms occur as a direct effect of a general medical condition the diagnosis of major depressive disorder remains appropriate and an additional diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition with manic features or with mixed features should be noted
specifiers
the following specifiers may be used to describe the current major depressive episode or if criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode the most recent major depressive episode
mild moderate severe without psychotic features severe with psychotic features in partial remission in full remission see p 376

mood disorders
chronic see p 382
with catatonic features see p 382 with melancholic features see p 383 with atypical features see p 384 with postpartum onset see p 386
the following specifiers may be used to indicate the pattern of the episodes and the presence of interepisode symptomatology for major depressive disorder recurrent

recording procedures
the diagnostic codes for major depressive disorder are selected as follows
1 the first three digits are 296

associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders major depressive disor- der is associated with high mortality up to 15% of individuals with severe major depressive disorder die by suicide epidemiological evidence also suggests that there is a fourfold increase in death rates in individuals with major depressive disorder who are over age 55 years individuals with major depressive disorder admitted to nursing homes may have a markedly increased likelihood of death in the first year among individuals seen in general medical settings those with major depressive disorder have more pain and physical illness and decreased physical social and role functioning
major depressive disorder may be preceded by dysthymic disorder 10% in epidemiological samples and 15%-25% in clinical samples it is also estimated that each year approximately 10% of individuals with dysthymic disorder alone will go on to have a first major depressive episode other mental disorders frequently co-occur with major depressive disordersubstance-related disorders panic disorder obsessive- compulsive disorder anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa borderline personality disorder
associated laboratory findings the laboratory abnormalities that are associated with major depressive disorder are those associated with major depressive episode see p 323 none of these findings are diagnostic of major depressive disorder but they have been noted to be abnormal in groups of individualswith major depressive disorder compared with control subjects most laboratory abnormalities are state dependent ie are present only when depressive symptoms are present however evidence suggests that some sleep eeg abnormalities persist into clinical remission or may precede the onset of the major depressive episode
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
major depressive disorder may be associated with chronic general medical conditions up to 20%-25% of individuals with certain general medical conditionsdiabetes myocardial infarction carcinomas stroke will develop major depressive disorder during the course of their general medical condition the management of the general medical condition is more complex and the prognosis is less favorable if major depressive disorder is present
specific culture age and gender features
specific culture-related features are discussed in the text for major depressive episode see p 324 major depressive disorder single or recurrent is twice as common in adolescent and adult females as in adolescent and adult males in prepubertal children boys and girls are equally affected rates in men and women are highest in the 25- to 44-year-old age group whereas rates are lower for both men and women over age 65 years
prevalence
studies of major depressive disorder have reported a wide range of values for the proportion of the adult population with the disorder the lifetime risk for major depressive disorder in community samples has varied from 10%to 25%for women and from 5% to 12% for men the point prevalence of major depressive disorder in adults in community samples has varied from 5% to 9% for women and from 2% to 3% for men the prevalence rates for major depressive disorder appear to be unrelated to ethnicity education income or marital status
course
major depressive disorder may begin at any age with an average age at onset in the mid-20s epidemiological data suggest that the age at onset is decreasing for those born more recently the course of major depressive disorder recurrent is variable some people have isolated episodes that are separated by many years without any depressive symptoms whereas others have clusters of episodes and still others have increasingly frequent episodes as they grow older some evidence suggests that the periods of remission generally last longer early in the course of the disorder the number of prior episodes predicts the likelihood of developing a subsequent major depressive episode approximately 50%-60% of individuals with major depressive disorder single episode can be expected to have a second episode individuals who have had two episodesmajor depressive disorder 341
342 mood disorders
have a 70% chance of having a third and individuals who have had three episodes have a 90% chance of having a fourth about 5%-10% of individuals with major depressive disorder single episode subsequently develop a manic episode ie develop bipolari disorder
major depressive episodes may end completely in about two-thirds of cases or only partially or not at all in about one-third of cases for individuals who have only partial remission there is a greater likelihood of developing additional episodes and of continuing the pattern of partial interepisode recovery the longitudinal course specifiers with full interepisode recovery and without full interepisode recovery see p 387 may therefore have prognostic value a number of individuals have preexisting dysthymic disorder prior to the onset of major depressive disorder single episode some evidence suggests that these individuals are more likely to have additional major depressive episodes have poorer interepisode recovery and may require additional acute-phasetreatmentandalongerperiod ofcontinuingtreatmenttoattainandmaintain a more thorough and longer-lasting euthymic state
follow-up naturalistic studies suggested that 1 year after the diagnosis of a major depressive episode 40% of individuals still have symptoms that are sufficiently severe to meet criteria for a full major depressive episode roughly 20% continue to have some symptoms that no longer meet full criteria for a major depressive episode ie major depressive disorder in partialremission and 40% have no mood disorder the severity of the initial major depressive episode appears to predict persistence chronic general medical conditions are also a risk factor for more persistent episodes
episodes of major depressive disorder often follow a severe psychosocial stressor such as the death of a loved one or divorce studies suggest that psychosocial events stressors may play a more significant role in the precipitation of the first or second episodes of major depressive disorder and may play less of a role in the onset of subsequent episodes chronic general medical conditions and substance dependence particularly alcohol or cocaine dependence may contribute to the onset or exacerba- tion of major depressive disorder
it is difficult to predict whether the first episode of a major depressive disorder in a young person will ultimately evolve into a bipolar disorder some data suggest that the acute onset of severe depression especially with psychotic features and psychomotor retardation in a young person without prepubertal psychopathology is more likely to predict a bipolar course a family history of bipolar disorder may also be suggestive of subsequent development of bipolar disorder
familial pattern
major depressive disorder is 15-3 times more common among first-degree biological relatives of persons with this disorder than among the general population there is evidence for an increased risk of alcohol dependence in adult first-degree biological relatives and there may be an increased incidence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the children of adults with this disorder
differential diagnosissee the differential diagnosis section for major depressive episode p 325 a history of a manic mixed or hypomanic episode precludes the diagnosis of major
depressive disorder the presence of hypomanic episodes without any history of manic episodes indicates a diagnosis of bipolar ii disorder the presence of manic or mixed episodes with or without hypomanic episodes indicates a diagnosis of bipolari disorder
major depressive episodes in major depressive disorder must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition the diagnosis is mood disorder due to a general medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical conditionmultiple sclerosis stroke hypothyroidism see p 366 this determination is based on the history laboratory findings or physical examination if it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition then the primary mood disorder is recorded on axis imajor depressive disorder and the general medical condition is recorded on axis iiimyocardial infarction this would be the case for example if the major depressive episode is considered to be the psychological consequence of having the general medical condition or if there is no etiological relationship between the major depressive episode and the general medical condition
a substance-induced mood disorder is distinguished from major depressive episodes in major depressive disorder by the fact that a substancea drug of abuse a medication or exposure to a toxin is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance see p 370 for example depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced mood disorder with depressive features with onset duringwithdrawal
dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder are differentiated based on severity chronicity and persistence in major depressive disorder the depressed mood must be present for most of the day nearly every day for a period of at least 2 weeks whereas dysthymic disorder must be present for more days than not over a period of at least 2 years the differential diagnosis between dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder is made particularly difficult by the fact that the two disorders share similar symptoms and that the differences between them in onset duration persistence and severity are not easy to evaluate retrospectively usually major depressive disorder consists of one or more discrete major depressive episodes that can be distinguished from the person's usual functioning whereas dysthymic disorder is characterized by chronic less severe depressive symptoms that have been present for many years if the initial onset of chronic depressive symptoms is of sufficient severity and number to meet criteria for a major depressive episode the diagnosis would be major depressive disorder chronic if the criteria are still met or major depressive disorder in partial remission if the criteria are no longer met the diagnosis of dysthymic disorder is made following major depressive disorder only if the dysthymic disorder was estab- lished prior to the first major depressive episode ie no major depressive episodes during the first 2 years of dysthymic symptoms or if there has been a full remission of the major depressive episode ie lasting at least 2 months before the onset of the dysthymic disorder
schizoaffective disorder differs from major depressive disorder with psychotic features by the requirement that in schizoaffective disorder there must be at least 2 weeks of delusions or hallucinations occurring in the absence of prominent mood symptoms depressive symptoms may be present during schizophrenia delusional disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified most commonly such depressive symptoms can be considered associated features of these disorders and do
major depressive disorder 343

not merit a separate diagnosis however when the depressive symptoms meet full criteria for a major depressive episode or are of particular clinical significance a diagnosis of depressive disorder not otherwise specified may be made in addition to the diagnosis of schizophrenia delusional disorder or psychotic disorder not other- wise specifiedschizophrenia catatonictype may be difficult to distinguish from major depressive disorder with catatonic features prior history or family history may be helpful in making this distinction
in elderly individuals it is often difficult to determine whether cognitive symptomsdisorientation apathy difficulty concentrating memory loss are better accounted for by a dementia or by a major depressive episode in major depressive disorder this differential diagnosis may be informed by a thorough general medical evaluation and consideration of the onset of the disturbance temporal sequencing of depressive and cognitive symptoms course of illness and treatment response the premorbid state of the individual may help to differentiate a major depressive disorder from dementia in dementia there is usually a premorbid history of declining cognitive function whereas the individual with major depressive disorder is much more likely to have a relatively normal premorbid state and abrupt cognitive decline associated with the depression

3004 dysthymic disorder

the essential feature of dysthymic disorder is a chronically depressed mood that occurs for most of the day more days than not for at least 2 years criterion a individuals with dysthymic disorder describe their mood as sad or down in the dumps in children the mood may be irritable rather than depressed and the required minimum duration is only 1 year during periods of depressed mood at least two of the following additional symptoms are present poor appetite or overeating insomnia or hypersomnia low energy or fatigue low self-esteem poor concentration or difficulty making decisions and feelings of hopelessness criterion b individuals may note the prominent presence of low interest and self-criticism often seeing themselves as uninteresting or incapable because these symptoms have become so much a part of the individual's day-to-day
346 mood disorders
experiencei've always been this way that's just how i am they are often not reported unless directly asked about by the interviewer
during the 2-year period 1 year for children or adolescents any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months criterion c the diagnosis of dysthymic disorder can be made only if the initial 2-year period of dysthymic symptoms is free of major depressive episodes criterion d if the chronic depressive symptoms include a major depressive episode during the initial 2 years then the diagnosis is major depressive disorder chronic if full criteria for a major depressive episode are met or major depressive disorder in partial remission if full criteria for a major depressive episode are not currently met after the initial 2 years of the dysthymic disorder major depressive episodes may be superimposed on the dysthymic disorder in such cases double depression both major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder are diagnosed once the person returns to a dysthymic baseline ie criteria for a major depressive episode are no longer met but dysthymic symptoms persist only dysthymic disorder is diagnosed
the diagnosis of dysthymic disorder is not made if the individual has ever had a manic episode p 328 a mixed episode p 333 or a hypomanic episode p 335 or if criteria have ever been met for cyclothymic disorder criterion e a separate diagnosis of dysthymic disorder is not made if the depressive symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or delusional disorder criterion f in which case they are regarded as associated features of these disorders dysthymic disorder is also not diagnosed if the disturbance is due to the direct physiological effects of a substancealcohol antihypertensive medications or a general medical conditionhypothyroidism alzheimer's disease criterion g the symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or academic or other important areas of functioning criterion h
specifiers
age at onset and the characteristic pattern of symptoms in dysthymic disorder may be indicated by using the following specifiers
early onset this specifier should be used if the onset of the dysthymic symptoms occurs before age 21 years such individuals are more likely to develop subsequent major depressive episodes
late onset this specifier should be used if the onset of the dysthymic symptoms occurs at age 21 or older
with atypical features this specifier should be used if the pattern of symptoms during the most recent 2 years of the disorder meets the criteria for with atypical features see p 384
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders the associated featuresof dysthymic disorder are similar to those for a major depressive episode p 323 several studies suggest that the most commonly encountered symptoms in dysthymic disorder may be feelings of inadequacy generalized loss of interest or pleasure social withdrawal feelings of guilt or brooding about the past subjective feelings of irritability or excessive anger and decreased activity effectiveness or productivity appendix b provides an alternative for criterion b for use in research studies that includes these items in
individuals with dysthymic disorder vegetative symptomssleep appetite weight change and psychomotor symptoms appear to be less common than for persons in a major depressive episode when dysthymic disorder without prior major depressive disorder is present it is a risk factor for developing major depressive disorder 10% of individuals with dysthymic disorder will develop major depressive disorder over the next year dysthymic disorder may be associated with borderline histrionic narcis- sistic avoidant and dependent personality disorders however the assessment of features of a personality disorder is difficult in such individuals because chronic mood symptoms may contribute to interpersonal problems or be associated with distorted self-perception other chronic axis i disorderssubstance dependence or chronic psychosocial stressors may be associated with dysthymic disorder in adults in children dysthymic disorder may be associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder conduct disorder anxiety disorders learning disorders and mental retardation
associated laboratory findings about 25%-50% of adults with dysthymic disorder have some of the same polysomnographic features that are found in some individuals with major depressive disorderreduced rapid eye movement remlatency increased remdensity reduced slow-wave sleep impaired sleep continuity those individuals with polysomnographic abnormalities more often have a positive family history for major depressive disorder and may respond better to antidepressant medications than those with dysthymic disorder without such findings whether polysomnographic abnormalities are also found in those with pure dysthymic disorder ie those with no prior history of major depressive episodes is not clear dexameth- asone nonsuppression in dysthymic disorder is not common unless criteria are also met for a major depressive episode
specific age and gender features
in children dysthymic disorder seems to occur equally in both sexes and often results in impaired school performance and social interaction children and adolescents with dysthymic disorder are usually irritable and cranky as well as depressed they have low self-esteem and poor social skills and are pessimistic in adulthood women are two to three times more likely to develop dysthymicdisorder than aremen
prevalence
the lifetime prevalence of dysthymic disorder with or without superimposed major depressive disorder is approximately 6% the point prevalence of dysthymic disorder is approximately 3%
course
dysthymic disorder often has an early and insidious onset ie in childhood adoles- cence or early adult life as well as a chronic course in clinical settings individuals with dysthymic disorder usually have superimposed major depressive disorder which is often the reason for seeking treatment if dysthymic disorder precedes the onset of major depressive disorder there is less likelihood that there will be spontaneous full interepisode recovery between major depressive episodes and a greater likelihood of having more frequent subsequent episodes3004 dysthymic disorder 347
348 mood disorders
familial pattern
dysthymic disorder is more common among first-degree biological relatives of people with major depressive disorder than among the general population
differential diagnosis
see the differential diagnosis section for major depressive disorder p 342the differential diagnosis between dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder is made particularly difficult by the facts that the two disorders share similar symptoms and that the differences between them in onset duration persistence and severity are not easy to evaluate retrospectively usually major depressive disorder consists of one or more discrete major depressive episodes that can be distinguished from the person's usual functioning whereas dysthymic disorder is characterized by chronic less severe depressive symptoms that have been present for many years when dysthymic disorder is of many years' duration the mood disturbance may not be easily distinguished from the person's usual functioning if the initial onset of chronic depressive symptoms is of sufficient severity and number to meet full criteria for a major depressive episode the diagnosis would be major depressive disorder chronic if the full criteria are still met or major depressive disorder in partial remission if the full criteria are no longer met the diagnosis of dysthymic disorder can be made following major depressive disorder only if the dysthymic disorder was established prior to the first major depressive episode ie no major depressive episodes during the first 2 years of dysthymic symptoms or if there has been a full remission of the major depressive disorder ie lasting at least 2 months before the onset of the dysthymic disorder
depressive symptoms may be a common associated feature of chronic psychotic disordersschizoaffective disorder schizophrenia delusional disorder a sep- arate diagnosis of dysthymic disorder is not made if the symptoms occur only during the course of the psychotic disorder including residual phases
dysthymic disorder must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition the diagnosis is mood disorder due to a general medical condition with depressive features if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific usually chronic general medical conditionmultiple sclerosis see p 366 this determination is based on the history laboratory findings or physical examination if it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition then the primary mood disorder is recorded on axis idysthymicdisorder and the general medical condition is recorded on axis iiidiabetes mellitus this would be the case for example if the depressive symptoms are considered to be the psychological conse- quence of having a chronic general medical condition or if there is no etiological relationship between the depressive symptoms and the general medical condition a substance-induced mood disorder is distinguished from a dysthymic disorder by the fact that a substancea drug of abuse a medication or exposure to a toxin is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance see p370
often there is evidence of a coexisting personality disturbance when an individual's presentation meets the criteria for both dysthymic disorder and a personality disorder both diagnoses are given
3004 dysthymic disorder 349 i diagnostic criteria for 3004 dysthymic disorder

6 situations in which the clinician has concluded that a depressive disorder is present but is unable to determine whether it is primary due to a general medical condition or substance induced
bipolar disorders
this section includes bipolar i disorder bipolar ii disorder cyclothymia and bipolar disorder not otherwise specified there are six separate criteria sets for bipolar i disorder single manic episode most recent episode hypomanic most recent episode manic most recent episode mixed most recent episode depressed and most recent episode unspecified bipolar i disorder single manic episode is used to describe individuals who are having a first episode of mania the remaining criteria sets are used to specify the nature of the current or most recent episode in individuals who have had recurrent mood episodes
bipolar i disorderthe essential feature of bipolar i disorder is a clinical course that is characterized by the occurrence of one or more manic episodes see p 328 or mixed episodes see
p 333 often individuals have also had one or more major depressive episodes see p 320 episodes of substance-induced mood disorder due to the direct effects of a medication other somatic treatments for depression a drug of abuse or toxin exposure or of mood disorder due to a general medical condition do not count toward a diagnosis of bipolar i disorder in addition the episodes are not better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and are not superimposed on schizophrenia schizophreniform disorder delusional disorder or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified bipolar i disorder is subclassified in the fourth digit of the code according to whether the individual is experiencing a first episode ie single manic episode or whether the disorder is recurrent recurrence is indicated by either a shift in the polarity of the episode or an interval between episodes of at least 2 months without manic symptoms a shift in polarity is defined as a clinical course in which a major depressive episode evolves into a manic episode or a mixed episode or in which a manic episode or a mixed episode evolves into a major depressive episode in contrast a hypomanic episode that evolves into a manic episode or a mixed episode or a manic episode that evolves into a mixed episode or vice versa is considered to be only a single episode for recurrent bipolar i disorders the nature of the current or most recent episode can be specified most recent episode hypomanic most recent episode manic most recent episode mixed most recent episode depressed most recent episode unspecified
specifiers
the following specifiers for bipolar i disorder can be used to describe the current manic mixed or major depressive episode or if criteria are not currently met for a manic mixed or major depressive episode the most recent manic mixed or major depressive episode
mild moderate severe without psychotic features severe with psychotic features in partial remission in full remission see p 376
with catatonic features see p 382 with postpartum onset see p 386
the following specifiers apply only to the current or most recent major depressive episode only if it is the most recent type of mood episode
chronic see p 382
with melancholic features see p 383 with atypical features see p 384
the following specifiers can be used to indicate the pattern of episodes

note that if the single episode of bipolar i disorder is a mixed episode the diagnosis would be indicated as 296ox bipolar i disorder single manic episode mixed
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders completed suicide occurs in 10%-15% of individuals with bipolar i disorder child abuse spouse abuse or other violent behavior may occur during severe manicepisodes or during those with psychotic features other associated problems include school truancy school failure occupational failure divorce or episodic antisocial behavior other associated mental disorders include anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder panic disorder social phobia substance-related disorders
associated laboratory findings there appear to be no laboratory features that distinguish major depressive episodes found in major depressive disorder from those in bipolar i disorder
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
an age at onset for a first manic episode after age 40 years should alert the clinician to the possibility that the symptoms may be due to a general medical condition or substance use there is some evidence that untreated thyroid disease worsens the prognosis of bipolar i disorderspecific culture age and gender featuresthere are no reports of differential incidence of bipolar i disorder based on race or ethnicity there is some evidence that clinicians may have a tendency to overdiagnose
schizophrenia instead of bipolar disorder in some ethnic groups and in younger individuals
approximately 10%-15% of adolescents with recurrent major depressive episodes will go on to develop bipolar i disorder mixed episodes appear to be more likely in adolescents and young adults than in older adults
recent epidemiological studies in the united states indicate that bipolar i disorder is approximately equally common in men and women unlike major depressive disorder which is more common in women gender appears to be related to the order of appearance of manic and major depressive episodes the first episode in males is more likely to be a manic episode the first episode in females is more likely to be a major depressive episode women with bipolar i disorder have an increased risk of developing subsequent episodes often psychotic in the immediate postpartum period some women have their first episode during the postpartum period the specifier with postpartum onset may be used to indicate that the onset of the episode is within 4 weeks of delivery see p 386 the premenstrual period may be associated with worsening of an ongoing major depressive manic mixed or hypomanic episode
prevalence
the lifetime prevalence of bipolar i disorder in community samples has varied from 04% to 16%
course
bipolar i disorder is a recurrent disorderâ€”more than 90% of individuals who have a single manic episode go on to have future episodes roughly 60%-70% of manic episodes occur immediately before or after a major depressive episode manic episodes often precede or follow the major depressive episodes in a characteristic pattern for a particular person the number of lifetime episodes both manic and major depressive tends to be higher for bipolar i disorder compared with major depressive disorder recurrent studies of the course of bipolar i disorder prior to lithium maintenance treatment suggest that on average four episodes occur in 10years the interval between episodes tends to decrease as the individual ages there is some evidence that changes in sleep-wake schedule such as occur during time zone changes or sleep deprivation may precipitate or exacerbate a manic mixed or hypomanic episode approximately 5%-15% of individuals with bipolar i disorder have multiple four or more mood episodes major depressive manic mixed or hypomanic that occur within a given year if this pattern is present it is noted by the specifier with rapid cycling see p 390 a rapid-cycling pattern is associated with a poorer prognosis
although the majority of individuals with bipolar i disorder return to a fully functional level between episodes some 20%-30% continue to display mood lability and interpersonal or occupational difficulties psychotic symptoms may develop after days or weeks in what was previously a nonpsychotic manic or mixed episode when an individual has manic episodes with psychotic features subsequent manic episodes are more likely to have psychotic features incomplete interepisode recovery is more common when the current episode is accompanied by mood-incongruent psychotic featuresbipolar i disorder 353
354 mood disorders
familial pattern
first-degree biological relatives of individuals with bipolar i disorder have elevated rates of bipolar i disorder 4%-24% bipolar ii disorder l%-5% and major depressive disorder 4%-24% twin and adoption studies provide strong evidence of a genetic influence for bipolar i disorder
differential diagnosis
major depressive manic mixed and hypomanic episodes in bipolar i disorder must be distinguished from episodes of a mood disorder due to a general medical condition the diagnosis is mood disorder due to a general medical condition for episodes that are judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical conditionmultiple sclerosis stroke hypothyroidism see p 366this determination is based on the history laboratory findings or physical examination
a substance-induced mood disorder is distinguished from major depressive manic or mixed episodes that occur in bipolar i disorder by the fact that a substancea drug of abuse a medication or exposure to a toxin is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance see p 370 symptoms like those seen in a manic mixed or hypomanic episode may be part of an intoxication with or withdrawal from a drug of abuse and should be diagnosed as a substance-induced mood disordereuphoric mood that occurs only in the context of intoxication with cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced mood disorder with manic features with onset during intoxication symptoms like those seen in a manic or mixed episode may also be precipitated by antidepressant treatment such as medication electroconvulsive therapy or light therapy such episodes may be diagnosed as a substance-induced mood disorderamitriptyline-induced mood disorder with manic features electroconvulsive therapy-induced mood disorder with manic features and would not count toward a diagnosis of bipolar i disorder however when the substance use or medication is judged not to fully account for the episodethe episode continues for a considerable period autonomously after the substance is discontinued the episode would count toward a diagnosis of bipolar i disorder
bipolar i disorder is distinguished from major depressive disorder and dysthy- mic disorder by the lifetime history of at least one manic or mixed episode bipolar i disorder is distinguished from bipolar ii disorder by the presence of one or more manic or mixed episodes when an individual previously diagnosed with bipolar ii disorder develops a manic or mixed episode the diagnosis is changed to bipolar i disorder
in cyclothymic disorder there are numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a manic episode and periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet symptom or duration criteria for a major depressive episode bipolar i disorder is distinguished from cyclothymic disorder by the presence of one or more manic or mixed episodes if a manic or mixed episode occurs after the first 2 years of cyclothymic disorder then cyclothymic disorder and bipolar i disorder may both be diagnosed
the differential diagnosis between psychotic disordersschizoaffective disorder schizophrenia and delusional disorder and bipolar i disorder may be difficult especially in adolescents because these disorders may share a number of presenting symptomsgrandiose and persecutory delusions irritability agitation
and catatonic symptoms particularly cross-sectionally and early in their course in contrast to bipolar i disorder schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder are all characterized by periods of psychotic symptoms that occur in the absence of prominent mood symptoms other helpful considerations include the accompanying symptoms previous course and family history manic and depressive symptoms may be present during schizophrenia delusional disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified but rarely with sufficient number duration and pervasiveness to meet criteria for a manic episode or a major depressive episode however when full criteria are met or the symptoms are of particular clinical significance a diagnosis of bipolar disorder not otherwise specified may be made in addition to the diagnosis of schizophrenia delusional disorder or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified
if there is a very rapid alternation over days between manic symptoms and depressive symptomsseveral days of purely manic symptoms followed by several days of purely depressive symptoms that do not meet minimal duration criteria for a manic episode or major depressive episode the diagnosis is bipolar disorder not otherwise specified

29689 bipolar ii disorder recurrent major depressive episodes with hypomanic episodes

the essential feature of bipolar ii disorder is a clinical course that is characterized by the occurrence of one or more major depressive episodes criterion a accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode criterion b hypomanic episodes should not be confused with the several days of euthymia that may follow remission of a major depressive episode the presence of a manic or mixed episode precludes the diagnosis of bipolar ii disorder criterion c episodes of substance-induced mood disorder due to the direct physiological effects of a medication other somatic treatments for depression drugs of abuse or toxin exposure or of mood disorder due to a general medical condition do not count toward a diagnosis of bipolar ii disorder in addition the episodes must not be better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and are not superimposed on schizophrenia schizophreniform disorder delusional disorder or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified criterion d the symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion e in some cases the hypomanic episodes themselves do not cause impairment instead the impairment may result from the major depressive episodes or from a chronic pattern of unpredictable mood episodes and fluctuating unreliable interpersonal or occupational functioning
individuals with bipolar ii disorder may not view the hypomanic episodes as pathological although others may be troubled by the individuals' erratic behavior often individuals particularlywhen in the midst of a major depressive episode do not recall periods of hypomania without reminders from close friends or relatives information from other informants is often critical in establishing the diagnosis of bipolar ii disorder
specifiers
the following specifiers for bipolar ii disorder should be used to indicate the current or most recent episode
hypomanic this specifier is used if the current or most recent episode is a hypomanic episode
depressed this specifier is used if the current or most recent episode is a major depressive episode
the following specifiers may be used to describe the current major depressive episode in bipolar ii disorder or the most recent major depressive episode ifcurrently in remission only if it is the most recent type of mood episode
mild moderate severe without psychotic features severe with psychotic features in partial remission in full remission see p 376

recording procedures
the diagnostic code for bipolar ii disorder is 29689 none of the specifiers are codable in recording the name of the diagnosis terms should be listed in the following order bipolar ii disorder specifiers indicating current or most recent episodehypomanic depressed as many specifiers as apply to the current or most recent major depressive episodemoderate with melancholic features with postpartum onset and as many specifiers as apply to the course of episodeswith seasonal pattern for example 29689 bipolar ii disorder depressed severe with psychotic features with melancholic features with seasonal pattern
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders completed suicide usu- ally during major depressive episodes is a significant risk occurring in 10%-15% of persons with bipolar ii disorder school truancy school failure occupational failure or divorce may be associated with bipolar ii disorder associated mental disorders include substance abuse or dependence anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder panic disorder social phobia and borderline personality disorder
associated laboratory findings there appear to be no laboratory features that distinguish major depressive episodes found in major depressive disorder from those in bipolar ii disorder
specific gender features
bipolar ii disorder may be more common in women than in men women with bipolar ii disorder may be at increased risk of developing subsequent episodes in the immediate postpartum period
prevalence
community studies suggest a lifetime prevalence of bipolar ii disorder of approximately 05%
courseroughly 60%-70% of the hypomanic episodes in bipolar ii disorder occur immediately before or after a major depressive episode hypomanic episodes often precede or follow
the major depressive episodes in a characteristic pattern for a particular person the number of lifetime episodes both hypomanic episodes and major depressive episodes tends to be higher for bipolar ii disorder compared with major depressive disorder recurrent the interval between episodes tends to decrease as the individual ages approximately 5%-15% of individuals with bipolar ii disorder have multiple four or more mood episodes hypomanic or major depressive that occur within a given year if this pattern is present it is noted by the specifier with rapid cycling see p 390 a rapid-cycling pattern is associated with a poorer prognosis
although the majority of individuals with bipolar ii disorder return to a fully functional level between episodes approximately 15% continue to display mood lability and interpersonal or occupational difficulties psychotic symptoms do not occur in hypomanic episodes and they appear to be less frequent in the major depressive episodes in bipolar ii disorder than is the case for bipolar i disorder some evidence is consistent with the notion that marked changes in sleep-wake schedule such as occur during time zone changes or sleep deprivation may precipitate or exacerbate hypomanic or major depressive episodes if a manic or mixed episode develops in the course of bipolar ii disorder the diagnosis is changed to bipolar i disorder over 5 years about 5%-15% of individuals with bipolar ii disorder will develop a manic episode
familial pattern
some studies have indicated that first-degree biological relatives of individuals with bipolar ii disorder have elevated rates of bipolar ii disorder bipolar i disorder and major depressive disorder compared with the general population
differential diagnosis
hypomanic and major depressive episodes in bipolar ii disorder must be distinguished from episodes of a mood disorder due to a general medical condition the diagnosis is mood disorder due to a general medical condition for episodes that are judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical conditionmultiple sclerosis stroke hypothyroidism see p 366 this determination is based on the history laboratory findings or physicalexamination
a substance-induced mood disorder is distinguished from hypomanic or major depressive episodes that occur in bipolar ii disorder by the fact that a substancea drug of abuse a medication or exposure to a toxin is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance see p 370 symptoms like those seen in a hypomanic episode may be part of an intoxication with or withdrawal from a drug of abuse and should be diagnosed as a substance-induced mood disordera major depressive-like episode occurring only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced mood disorder with depressive features with onset during with- drawal symptoms like those seen in a hypomanic episode may also be precipitated by antidepressant treatment such as medication electroconvulsive therapy or light therapy such episodes may be diagnosed as a substance-induced mood disorderamitriptyline-induced mood disorder with manic features electroconvulsivetherapy- induced mood disorder with manic features and would not count toward a diagnosis of bipolar ii disorder however when the substance use or medication is judged not to fully account for the episodethe episode continues for a considerable period
29689 bipolar ii disorder 361
362 mood disorders
autonomously after the substance is discontinued the episode would count toward a diagnosis of bipolar ii disorder
bipolar ii disorder is distinguished from major depressive disorder and dysthy- mic disorder by the lifetime history of at least one hypomanic episode bipolar ii disorder is distinguished from bipolar i disorder by the presence of one or more manic or mixed episodes in the latter when an individual previously diagnosed with bipolar ii disorder develops a manic or mixed episode the diagnosis is changed to bipolar i disorder
in cyclothymic disorder there are numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and numerous periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet symptom or duration criteria for a major depressive episode bipolar ii disorder is distinguished from cyclothymic disorder by the presence of one or more major depressive episodes if a major depressive episode occurs after the first 2 years of cyclothymic disorder the additional diagnosis of bipolar ii disorder is given

30113 cyclothymic disorder

the essential feature of cyclothymic disorder is a chronic fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms see p 335 and numerous periods of depressive symptoms see p 320 criterion a the hypomanic symptoms are of insufficient number severity pervasiveness or duration to meet full criteria for a manic episode and the depressive symptoms are of insufficient number severity pervasive- ness or duration to meet full criteria for a major depressive episode during the 2-year period 1 year for children or adolescents any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months criterion b the diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is made only if the initial 2-year period of cyclothymicsymptoms is free of major depressive manic and mixed episodes criterion c after the initial 2 years of the cyclothymic disorder manic or mixed episodes may be superimposed on the cyclothymic disorder in which case both cyclothymic disorder and bipolar i disorder are diagnosed similarly after the initial 2 years of cyclothymic disorder major depressive episodes may be superimposed on the cyclothymic disorder in which case both cyclothymic disorder and bipolar ii disorder are diagnosed the diagnosis is not made if the pattern of mood swings is better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder or is superimposed on a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia schizophreniform disorder delusional disorder or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified criterion d in which case the mood symptoms are considered to be associated features of the psychotic disorder the mood disturbance must also not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substancea drug of abuse a medication or a general medical conditionhyperthyroidism criterion e although some people may function particularlywell during some of the
364 mood disorders
periods of hypomania overall there must be clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning as a result of the mood disturbance criterion f the impairment may develop as a result of prolonged periods of cyclical often unpredictable mood changesthe person may be regarded as temperamental moody unpredictable inconsistent or unreliable
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders substance-related disor- ders and sleep disorders ie difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep may be present
specific age and gender features
cyclothymic disorder often begins early in life and is sometimes considered to reflect a temperamental predisposition to other mood disorders especially bipolar disorders in community samples cyclothymic disorder is apparently equally common in men and in women in clinical settings women with cyclothymic disorder may be more likely to present for treatment than men
prevalence
studies have reported a lifetime prevalence of cyclothymic disorder of from 04%to 1% prevalence in mood disorders clinics may range from 3% to 5%
course
cyclothymic disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult life onset of cyclothymic disorder late in adult life may suggest a mood disorder due to a general medical condition such as multiple sclerosis cyclothymic disorder usually has an insidious onset and a chronic course there is a 15%-50% risk that the person will subsequently develop bipolar i or ii disorder
familial pattern
major depressive disorder and bipolar i or ii disorder appear to be more common among first-degree biological relatives of persons with cyclothymic disorder than among the general population there may also be an increased familial risk of substance-related disorders
differential diagnosis
cyclothymic disorder must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition the diagnosis is mood disorder due to a general medical condition with mixed features when the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific usually chronic general medical conditionhyperthyroidism see p 366 this determination is based on the history laboratory findings or physical examination if it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not
30113 cyclothymic disorder 365
the direct physiological consequence of the general medical condition then the primary mood disorder is recorded on axis icyclothymicdisorder and the general medical condition is recorded on axis iii this would be the case for example if the mood symptoms are considered to be the psychological consequence of having a chronic general medical condition or if there is no etiological relationship between the mood symptoms and the general medical condition
a substance-induced mood disorder is distinguished from cyclothymic disorder by the fact that a substance especially stimulants is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance see p 370 the frequent mood swings that are suggestive of cyclothymic disorder usually dissipate following cessation of drug use
bipolar i disorder with rapid cycling and bipolar n disorder with rapid cycling both may resemble cyclothymic disorder by virtue of the frequent marked shifts in mood by definition the mood states in cyclothymic disorder do not meet the full criteria for a major depressive manic or mixed episode whereas the specifier with rapid cycling requires that full mood episodes be present if a major depressive manic or mixed episode occurs during the course of an established cyclothymic disorder the diagnosis of either bipolar i disorder for a manic or mixed episode or bipolar ii disorder for a major depressive episode is given along with the diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder
borderline personality disorder is associated with marked shifts in mood that may suggest cyclothymic disorder if the criteria are met for each disorder both borderline personality disorder and cyclothymic disorder may be diagnosed
diagnostic criteria for 30113 cyclothymic disorder
a for at least 2 years the presence of numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms see p 338 and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode note in children and adolescents the duration must be at least 1 year

29383 mood disorder
due to a general medical condition

the essential feature of mood disorder due to a general medical condition is a prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition the mood disturbance may involve depressed mood markedly diminished interest or pleasure or elevated expansive or irritable mood criterion a although the clinical presentation of the mood disturbance may resemble that of a major depressive manic mixed or hypomanic episode the full criteria for one of these episodes need not be met the predominant symptom type may
29383 mood disorder due to a general medical condition 367
be indicated by using one of the following subtypes with depressive features with major depressive-like episode with manic features or with mixed features there must be evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition criterion b the mood disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorderadjustment disorder with depressed mood that occurs in response to the psychosocial stress of having the general medical condition criterion c the diagnosis is also not made if the mood disturbance occurs only during the course of a delirium criterion d the mood disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion e in some cases the individual may still be able to function but only with markedly increased effort
in determining whether the mood disturbance is due to a general medical condition the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical condition further the clinician must establish that the mood disturbance is etiologically related to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism a careful and com- prehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the mood disturbance and the general medical condition is etiological several considerations provide some guidance in this area one consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset exacerbation or remission of the general medical condition and that of the mood disturbance a second consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of primary mood disordersatypical age at onset or course or absence of family history evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a direct association between the general medical condition in question and the development of mood symptoms can provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation in addition the clinician must also judge that the disturbance is not better accounted for by a primary mood disorder a substance-induced mood disorder or other primary mental disordersadjustment disorder this determination is explained in greater detail in the mentaldisorders due to a general medical condition section p 165
in contrast to major depressive disorder mood disorder due to a general medical condition with depressive features appears to be nearly equally distributed by gender mood disorder due to a general medical condition increases the risk of attempted and completed suicide rates of suicide are variable depending on the particular general medical condition with chronic incurable and painful conditionsmalignancy spinal cord injury peptic ulcer disease huntington's disease acquired immunodefici- ency syndrome [aids] end-stage renal disease head injury carrying the greatest risk for suicide
subtypes
one of the following subtypes may be used to indicate which of the following symptom presentations predominates
with depressive features this subtype is used if the predominant mood is depressed but the full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met with major depressiveâ€”like episode this subtype is used if the full criteria except criterion d for a major depressive episode see p 327 are met
368 mood disorders
with manic features this subtype is used if the predominant mood is elevated euphoric or irritable
with mixed features this subtype is used if the symptoms of both mania and depression are present but neither predominates
recording procedures
in recording the diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition the clinician should note both the specific phenomenology of the disturbance including the appropriate subtype and the identified general medical condition judged to be causing the disturbance on axis i29383 mood disorder due to thyrotoxicosis with manic features the icd-9-cm code for the general medical condition should also be noted on axis iii2429 thyrotoxicosis see appendix g for a list of selected icd-9-cm diagnostic codes for general medical conditions
a separate diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition is not given if the depressive symptoms develop exclusively during the course of dementia of the alzheimer's type or vascular dementia in this case the depressive symptoms are indicated by specifying the subtype with depressed mood29021 dementia of the alzheimer's type with late onset with depressed mood
associated generalmedicalconditions
a variety of general medical conditions may cause mood symptoms these conditions include degenerative neurological conditionsparkinson's disease huntington's disease cerebrovascular diseasestroke metabolic conditionsvitamin b12 deficiency endocrine conditionshyper- and hypothyroidism hyper- and hypoparathyroidism hyper- and hypoadrenocorticism autoimmune conditionssystemic lupus erythematosus viral or other infectionshepatitis mononucleosis human immunodeficiency virus [hiv] and certain cancerscarcinoma of the pancreas the associated physical examination findings laboratory findings and patterns of prevalence or onset reflect the etiological general medical condition
prevalence
prevalence estimates for mood disorder due to a general medical condition are confined to those presentations with depressive features it has been observed that 25%-40% of individuals with certain neurological conditions including parkinson's disease huntington's disease multiple sclerosis stroke and alzheimer's disease will develop a marked depressive disturbance at some point during the course of the illness for general medical conditions without direct central nervous system involvement rates are far more variable ranging from more than 60%in cushing's syndrome to less than 8%in end-stage renal disease
differential diagnosis
a separate diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition is not given if the mood disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium when the clinician wishes to indicate the presence of clinically significant mood symptoms that
29383 mood disorder due to a general medical condition 369
occur in the context of a dementia due to a general medical condition a separate diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition can be indicated an exception to this is when depressive symptoms occur exclusively during the course of dementia of the alzheimer's type or vascular dementia in these cases only a diagnosis of dementia of the alzheimer's type or of vascular dementia with the subtype with depressed mood is given a separate diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition is not made if the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptomsmood and anxiety the specific mental disorder due to a general medical condition depends on which symptoms predominate in the clinicalpicture
if there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use including medications with psychoactive effects withdrawal from a substance or exposure to a toxin a substance-induced mood disorder should be considered it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation symptoms that occur during or shortly after ie within 4 weeks of substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance-induced disorder depending on the character duration or amount of the substance used if the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a general medical condition and substance use both diagnoses ie mood disorder due to a general medical condition and substance-induced mood disorder are given
mood disorder due to a general medical condition must be distinguished from

substance-induced mood disorder

the essential feature of substance-induced mood disorder is a prominent and persistent disturbance in mood criterion a that is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance ie a drug of abuse a medication other somatic treatment for depression or toxin exposure criterion b depending on the nature of the substance and the context in which the symptoms occur ie during intoxication or withdrawal the disturbance may involve depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure or elevated expansive or irritable mood although the clinical presentation of the mood disturbance may resemble that of a major depressive manic mixed or hypomanic episode the full criteria for one of these episodes need not be met the predominant symptom type may be indicated by using one of the following subtypes with depressive features with manic features with mixed features the disturbance must not be better accounted for by a mood disorder that is not substance induced
substance-induced mood disorder 371
criterion c the diagnosis is not made if the mood disturbance occurs only during the course of a delirium criterion d the symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning crite- rion e in some cases the individual may still be able to function but only with markedly increased effort this diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the mood symptoms are in excess of those usually associated with the intoxication or withdrawal syndrome and when the mood symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention
a substance-induced mood disorder is distinguished from a primary mood disorder by considering the onset course and other factors for drugs of abuse there must be evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory findings of intoxication or withdrawal substance-induced mood disorders arise only in association with intoxication or withdrawal states whereas primary mood disorders may precede the onset of substance use or may occur during times of sustained abstinence because the withdrawal state for some substances can be relatively protracted the onset of the mood symptoms can occur up to 4 weeks after the cessation of substance use another consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of primary mood disordersatypical age at onset or course for example the onset of a manic episode after age 45 years may suggest a substance-induced etiology in contrast factors that suggest that the mood symptoms are better accounted for by a primary mood disorder include persistence of mood symptoms for a substantial period of time ie about a month after the end of substance intoxication or acute substance withdrawalthe development of mood symptoms that are substantially in excess of what would be expected given the type or amount of the substance used or the duration of use or a history of prior recurrent primary episodes of mood disorder
some medicationsstimulants steroids l-dopa antidepressants or other somatic treatments for depressionelectroconvulsive therapy or light therapy can induce manic-like mood disturbances clinical judgment is essential to determine whether the treatment is truly causal or whether a primary mood disorder happened to have its onset while the person was receiving the treatment for example manic symptoms that develop in a person while he or she is taking lithium would not be diagnosed as substance-induced mood disorder because lithium is not likely to induce manic-like episodes on the other hand a depressive episode that developed within the first several weeks of beginning alpha-methyldopa an antihypertensive agent in a person with no history of mood disorder would qualify for the diagnosis of alpha- methyldopa-induced mood disorder with depressive features in some cases a previously established conditionmajor depressive disorder recurrent can recur while the person is coincidentally taking a medication that has the capacity to cause depressive symptomsl-dopa birth-control pills in such cases the clinician must make a judgment as to whether the medication is causative in this particular situation for a more detailed discussion of substance-related disorders see p 175
subtypes and specifiersone of the following subtypes may be used to indicate which of the following symptom presentations predominateswith depressive features this subtype is used if the predominant mood is depressed
372 mood disorders
with manic features this subtype is used if the predominant mood is elevated euphoric or irritable
with mixed features this subtype is used if the symptoms of both mania and depression are present but neither predominates
the context of the development of the mood symptoms may be indicated by using one of the following specifiers
with onset during intoxication this specifier should be used if criteria for intoxication with the substance are met and the symptoms develop during the intoxication syndrome
with onset during withdrawal this specifier should be used if criteria for withdrawal from the substance are met and the symptoms develop during or shortly after a withdrawal syndrome
recording procedures
the name of the substance-induced mood disorder begins with the specific substance or somatic treatmentcocaine amitriptyline electroconvulsive therapy that is presumed to be causing the mood symptoms the diagnostic code is selected from the listing of classes of substances provided in the criteria set for substances that do not fit into any of the classesamitriptyline and for other somatic treatmentselectroconvulsive therapy the code for other substance should be used in addition for medications prescribed at therapeutic doses the specific medication can be indicated by listing the appropriate e-code see appendix g the name of the disordercocaine-induced mood disorder is followed by the subtype indicating the predominant symptom presentation and the specifier indicating the context in which the symptoms developed29284 cocaine-induced mood disorder with depressive features with onset during withdrawal when more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of mood symptoms each should be listed separately29284 cocaine-induced mood disorder with manic features with onset during withdrawal 29284 light therapy-induced mood disorder with manic features if a substance is judged to be the etiological factor but the specific substance or class of substances is unknown the category 29284 unknown substance-induced mood disorder may be used
specific substances
mood disorders can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances alcohol amphetamine and related substances cocaine hallucinogens inhalants opioids phencyclidine and related substances sedatives hypnotics and anxiolytics and other or unknown substances mood disorders can occur in association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances alcohol amphetamine and related substances cocaine sedatives hypnotics and anxiolytics and other or unknown substances
some of the medications reported to evoke mood symptoms include anesthetics analgesics anticholinergics anticonvulsants antihypertensives antiparkinsonian medi- cations antiulcer medications cardiac medications oral contraceptives psychotropic medicationsantidepressants benzodiazepines antipsychotics disulfiram muscle
substance-induced mood disorder 373
relaxants steroids and sulfonamides some medications have an especially high likelihood of producing depressive featureshigh doses of reserpine cortico- steroids anabolic steroids note that this is not an exhaustive list of possible medications and that many medications may occasionally produce an idiosyncratic depressive reaction heavy metals and toxinsvolatile substances such as gasoline and paint organophosphate insecticides nerve gases carbon monoxide carbon dioxide may also cause mood symptoms
differential diagnosis
mood symptoms occur commonly in substance intoxication and substance with- drawal and the diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation a diagnosis of substance-induced mood disorder should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the mood symptoms are judged to be in excess of those usually associated with the intoxication or withdrawal syndrome and when the mood symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention for example dysphoric mood is a characteristic feature of cocaine withdrawal cocaine-induced mood disorder should be diagnosed instead of cocainewithdrawal only if the mood disturbance is substantially more intense than what is usually encountered with cocaine withdrawal and is sufficiently severe to be a separate focus of attention and treatment
if substance-induced mood symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium the mood symptoms are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately in substance-induced presentations that contain a mix of different types of symptomsmood psychotic and anxiety symptoms the specific type of substance-induced disorder to be diagnosed depends on which type of symptoms predominates in the clinical presentation
a substance-induced mood disorder is distinguished from a primary mood disorder by the fact that a substance is judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms p 371
a substance-induced mood disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or general medical condition must have its onset while the person is receiving the medicationantihypertensive medication or during withdrawal if there is a withdrawal syndrome associated with the medication once the treatment is discon- tinued the mood symptoms will usually remit within days to several weeks depending on the half-life of the substance and the presence of a withdrawal syndrome if symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks other causes for the mood symptoms should be considered
because individuals with general medical conditions often take medications for those conditions the clinician must consider the possibility that the mood symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the general medical condition rather than the medication in which case mood disorder due to a general medical condition is diagnosed the history often provides the primarybasis for such a judgmentattimes a change in the treatment for the general medical conditionmedication substitution or discontinuation may be needed to determine empirically for that person whether the medication is the causative agent if the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a general medical condition and substance use both diagnoses ie mood
374 mood disorders
disorder due to a general medical condition and substance-induced mood disorder may be given when there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the mood symptoms are due to a substance including a medication or to a general medical condition or are primary ie not due to either a substance or a general medical condition depressive disorder not otherwise specified or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified would be indicated
diagnostic criteria for substance-induced mood disorder
a a prominent and persistent disturbance in mood predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by either or both of the following
1 depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost allactivities
2 elevated expansive or irritable mood
b there is evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory findings of either 1 or 2
1 the symptoms in criterion a developed during or within a month of substance intoxication or withdrawal
2 medication use is etiologically related to the disturbance
c the disturbance is not better accounted for by a mood disorder that is not substance induced evidence that the symptoms are better accounted for by a mood disorder that is not substance induced might include the following the symptoms precede the onset of the substance use or medication use the symptoms persist for a substantial period of timeabout a month after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication or are substantially in excess of what would be expected given the type or amount of the substance used or the duration of use or there is other evidence that suggests the existence of an independent non-substance-induced mood disordera history of recurrent major depressive episodes
d the disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium
e the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning
note this diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxi- cation or substance withdrawal only when the mood symptoms are in excess of those usually associated with the intoxication or withdrawal syndrome and when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attentioncontinued

melancholic features specifier
the specifier with melancholic features can be applied to the current or most recent major depressive episode that occurs in the course of major depressive disorder and to a major depressive episode in bipolar i or ii disorder only if it is the most recent type of mood episode the essential feature of a major depressive episode with melancholic features is loss of interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities or a lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli the individual's depressed mood does not improve even temporarilywhen something good happens criterionainaddition at least three of the following symptoms are present a distinct quality of the depressed mood depression that is regularly worse in the morning early morning awakening psychomotor retardation or agitation significant anorexia or weight loss or excessive or inappropriate guilt criterion b
the specifier with melancholic features is applied if these features are present at the nadir of the episode there is a near-complete absence of the capacity for pleasure not merely a diminution a guideline for evaluating the lack of reactivity of mood is that even for very desired events the depressed mood does not brighten at all or brightens only partiallyup to 20%-40% of normal for only minutes at a time the distinct quality of mood that is characteristic of the with melancholic features specifier is experienced by individualsas qualitativelydifferent from the sadness experienced during bereavement or a nonmelancholic depressive episode this may be elicited by asking the person to compare the quality of the current depressed mood with the mood experienced after the death of a loved one a depressed mood that is described as merely more severe longer-lasting or present without a reason is not considered distinct in quality psychomotor changes are nearly always present and are observable by others
384 mood disorders
individuals with melancholic features are less likely to have a premorbid personality disorder to have a clear precipitant to the episode and to respond to a trial of placebo medication they are more likely to have responded to antidepressant medications or electroconvulsive therapy in the past and are also more likely to respond in the current episode melancholic features are encountered equally in both genders but are more likely in older individuals these features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the same individual they are more frequent in inpatients as opposed to outpatients and are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes and are more likely to occur in those with psychotic features melancholic features are more frequently associated with laboratory findings of dexamethasone nonsuppression hyperadrenocorticism reduced rapid eye movement rem latency abnormal tyramine challenge test and an abnormal asymmetry on dichotic listening tasks

specify if
with melancholic features can be applied to the current or most recent major depressive episode in major depressive disorder and to a major depressive episode in bipolar i or bipolar ii disorder only if it is the most recent type of mood episode

1 loss of pleasure in all or almost all activities
2 lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli does not feel much
better even temporarily when something good happens
b three or more of the following
1 distinct quality of depressed mood ie the depressed mood is experienced as distinctly different from the kind of feeling experi- enced after the death of a loved one
2 depression regularly worse in the morning
3 early morning awakening at least 2 hours before usual time of
awakening

atypical features specifier
the specifier with atypical features can be applied to the current or most recent major depressive episode in major depressive disorder and to a major depressive episode in bipolar i or bipolar ii disorder only if it is the most recent type of mood episode or to dysthymic disorder the essential features are mood reactivity criterion a and the presence of at least two of the following features criterion b increased appetite or
weight gain hypersomnia leaden paralysis and a long-standing pattern of extreme sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection these features predominate during the most recent 2-week period or the most recent 2-year period for dysthymic disorder the specifier with atypical features is not given if the criteria for with melancholic features or with catatonic features have been met during the same major depressive episode
mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive eventsa visit from children compliments from others mood may become euthymic not sad even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances remain favorable increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy leaden or weighted down usually in the arms or legs this is generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time unlike the other atypical features pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of adult life rejection sensitivity occurs both when the person is and is not depressed though it may be exacerbated during depressive periods the problems that result from rejection sensitivity must be significant enough to result in functional impairment there may be stormy relationships with frequent disruptions and an inability to sustain a longer-lasting relationship the individual's reaction to rebuff or criticism may be manifested by leaving work early using substances excessively or displaying other clinically significant maladaptive behavioral responses there may also be avoid- ance of relationships due to the fear of interpersonal rejection being occasionally touchy or overemotional does not qualify as a manifestation of interpersonal rejection sensitivity personality disordersavoidant personality disorder and anxiety disordersseparation anxiety disorder specific phobia or social phobia may be more common in those with atypical features the laboratory findings associated with a major depressive episode with melancholic features are generally not present in association with an episode with atypical features
atypical features are two to three times more common in women individuals with atypical features report an earlier age at onset of their depressive episodeswhile in high school and frequently have a more chronic less episodic course with only partial interepisode recovery younger individuals may be more likely to have episodes with atypical features whereas older individuals may more often have episodes with melancholic features episodes with atypical features are more common in bipolar i disorder bipolar ii disorder and in major depressive disorder recurrent occurring in a seasonal pattern

postpartum onset specifier
the specifier with postpartum onset can be applied to the current or most recent major depressive manic or mixed episode of major depressive disorder bipolar i disorder or bipolar ii disorder or to brief psychotic disorder p 302 if onset is within 4 weeks after delivery of a child in general the symptomatology of the postpartum major depressive manic or mixed episode does not differ from the symptomatology in nonpostpartum mood episodes and may include psychotic features a fluctuating course and mood lability may be more common in postpartum episodes when delusions are present they often concern the newborn infantthe newborn is possessed by the devil has special powers or is destined for a terrible fate in both the psychotic and nonpsychotic presentations there may be suicidal ideation obsessional thoughts regarding violence to the child lack of concentration and psychomotor agitation women with postpartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety panic attacks spontaneous crying long after the usual duration of baby blues ie 3-7 days postpartum disinterest in their new infant and insomnia more likely to manifest as difficulty falling asleep than as early morning awakening
many women feel especially guilty about having depressive feelings at a time when they believe they should be happy they may be reluctant to discuss their symptoms or their negative feelings toward the child less-than-optimal development of the mother- infant relationship may result from the clinical condition itself or from separations from the infant infanticide is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes that are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed but it can also occur in severe postpartum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations postpartum mood major depressive manic or mixed episodes with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 deliveries and may be more common in primiparous women the risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is particularlyincreased for women with prior postpar- tum mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a prior history of a mood disorder
longitudinal course specifiers 387
especially bipolar i disorder once a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features the risk of recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50% there is also some evidence of increased risk of postpartum psychotic mood episodes among women without a history of mood disorders with a family history of bipolar disorders postpartum episodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period which is distinguished by a decreased level of awareness or attention

a number of specifiers for mood disorders are provided to increase diagnostic specificity and create more homogeneous subgroups assist in treatment selection and improve the prediction of prognosis specifiers that describe the course of recurrent episodes include longitudinal course specifiers with or without full interepisode recovery seasonal pattern and rapid cycling these specifiers cannot be coded table 2 indicates which course specifiers apply to each mood disorder see p 388
longitudinal course specifiers
with and without full interepisode recovery
the specifiers with full interepisode recovery and without full interepisode recovery are provided to help characterize the course of illness in individuals with recurrent major depressive disorder bipolar i disorder or bipolar ii disorder these specifiers should be applied to the period of time between the two most recent episodes the character- ization of course is further enhanced by noting the presence of antecedent dysthymic disorder
the four graphs below depict prototypical courses a shows the course of major depressive disorder recurrent in which there is no antecedent dysthymic disorder and there is a period of full remission between the episodes this course pattern predicts the best future prognosis b shows the course of major depressive disorderrecurrent in which there is no antecedent dysthymic disorder but in which prominent symptoms persist between the two most recent episodesâ€”that is no more than partial remission is attained c shows the rare pattern present in fewer than 3% of individuals with major depressive disorder of major depressive disorder recurrent with antecedent dysthy-

d shows the course of major depressive disorder recurrent in which there is antecedent
dysthymic disorder and in which there is no period of full remission between the two most recent episodes this pattern commonly referred to as double depression see p 346 is seen in about 20%-25% of individuals with major depressive disorder
in general individualswith a history of without full interepisode recovery between episodes have a persistence of that pattern between subsequent episodes they also appear more likely to have more major depressive episodes than those with full interepisode recovery dysthymic disorder prior to the first episode of major depressive disorder is most likely to be associated with lack of full interepisode recovery subsequently these specifiers may also be applied to the period of time between the most recent mood episodes in bipolar i disorder or bipolar ii disorder to indicate presence or absence of mood symptomatology

seasonal pattern specifier
the specifier with seasonal pattern can be applied to the pattern of major depressive episodes in bipolar i disorder bipolar ii disorder or major depressive disorder recurrent the essential feature is the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at characteristictimes of the year in most cases the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring less commonly there may be recurrent summer depressive episodes this pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during the last 2 years without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during this period in addition the seasonal depressive episodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over the individual's lifetime this specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better explained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressorsseasonal unemployment or school schedule major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often characterized by prominent anergy hypersomnia over- eating weight gain and a craving for carbohydrates it is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely in major depressive disorder recurrent or in bipolar disorders however within the bipolar disorders group a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar ii disorder than in bipolar i disorder in some individuals the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular season bright visible-spectrum light used in treatment may be associated with switches into manic or hypomanic episodes
the prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude age and sex prevalence increases with higher latitudes age is also a strong predictor of seasonality with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes women comprise 60%-90% of persons with seasonal pattern but it is unclear whether female gender is a specific risk factor over and above the risk associated with recurrent major depressive disorder althoughthis specifier applies to seasonal occurrence of full major depressive episodes some research suggests that a seasonal pattern may also describe the presentation in some individualswith recurrent winter depressive episodes that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode

d seasonal major depressive episodes as described above substantially outnumber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have occurred over the individual's lifetime
rapid-cycling specifier
the specifier with rapid cycling can be applied to bipolar i disorder or bipolar ii disorder the essential feature of a rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is the occurrence of four or more mood episodes during the previous 12 months these episodes can occur in any combination and order the episodes must meet both the duration and symptom criteria for a major depressive manic mixed or hypomanic episode and must be demarcated by either a period of full remission or by a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity manic hypomanic and mixed episodes are counted as being on the same polea manic episode immediately followed by a mixed episode counts as only one episode in considering the specifier with rapid cycling except for the fact that they occur more frequently the episodes that occur in a rapid-cycling pattern are no different from those that occur in a non-rapid-cycling pattern mood episodes that count toward defining a rapid-cycling pattern exclude those episodes directly caused by a substancecocaine corticosteroids or a general medical condition
rapid cycling occurs in approximately 5%-15% of persons with bipolar disorder seen in mood disorders clinics whereas in bipolar disorder in general the sex ratio is equal women comprise 70%-90% of individualswith a rapid-cyclingpattern the mood
episodes are not linked to any phase of the menstrual cycle and occur in both pre- and postmenopausal women rapid cycling may be associated with hypothyroidism certain neurological conditionsmultiple sclerosis mental retardation head injury or antidepressant treatment rapid cycling can occur at any time during the course of bipolar disorder and may appear and disappear particularly if it is associated with antidepressant use the development of rapid cycling is associated with a poorer longer-term prognosis

anxiety disorders
the following disorders are contained in this section panic disorder without agoraphobia panic disorder with agoraphobia agoraphobia without history of panic disorder specific phobia social phobia obsessive-compulsive disorder post- traumatic stress disorder acute stress disorder generalized anxiety disorder anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition substance-induced anxiety disorder and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified because panic attacks and agoraphobia
occur in the context of several of these disorders criteria sets for a panic attack and for agoraphobia are listed separately at the beginning of this section
a panic attack is a discrete period in which there is the sudden onset of intense apprehension fearfulness or terror often associated with feelings of impending doom during these attacks symptoms such as shortness of breath palpitations chest pain or discomfort choking or smothering sensations and fear of going crazy or losing control are present
agoraphobia is anxiety about or avoidance of places or situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing or in which help may not be available in the event of having a panic attack or panic-like symptoms
panic disorder without agoraphobia is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks about which there is persistent concern panic disorder with agora- phobia is characterized by both recurrent unexpected panic attacks and agoraphobia
agoraphobiawithouthistoryofpanicdisorder ischaracterizedbythe presence of agoraphobia and panic-like symptoms without a history of unexpected panic attacks specific phobia is characterized by clinically significant anxiety provoked by
exposure to a specific feared object or situation often leading to avoidance behavior social phobia is characterized by clinically significant anxiety provoked by exposure to certain types of social or performance situations often leading to avoidance
behavior
obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions which cause
marked anxiety or distress and/or by compulsions which serve to neutralize anxiety posttraumatic stress disorder is characterized by the reexperiencing of an extremely traumatic event accompanied by symptoms of increased arousal and by
avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma
acute stress disorder is characterized by symptoms similar to those of posttrau-
matic stress disorder that occur immediately in the aftermath of an extremely traumatic eventgeneralized anxiety disorder is characterized by at least 6 months of persistent and excessive anxiety and worry393
394 anxiety disorders
anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition is characterized by prominent symptoms of anxiety that are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition
substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by prominent symptoms of anxiety that are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a drug of abuse a medication or toxin exposure
anxiety disorder not otherwise specified is included for coding disorders with prominent anxiety or phobic avoidance that do not meet criteria for any of the specific anxiety disorders defined in this section or anxiety symptoms about which there is inadequate or contradictoryinformation
because separation anxiety disorder characterized by anxiety related to separation from parental figures usually develops in childhood it is included in the disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy childhood or adolescence section see p 110 phobic avoidance that is limited to genital sexual contact with a sexual partner is classified as sexual aversion disorder and is included in the sexual and gender identity disorders section see p 499
panic attack
features
because panic attacks occur in the context of several different anxiety disorders the text and criteria set for a panic attack are provided separately in this section the essential feature of a panic attack is a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort that is accompanied by at least 4 of 13 somatic or cognitive symptoms the attack has a sudden onset and builds to a peak rapidly usually in 10 minutes or less and is often accompanied by a sense of imminent danger or impending doom and an urge to escape the 13 somatic or cognitive symptoms are palpitations sweating trembling or shaking sensations of shortness of breath or smothering feeling of choking chest pain or discomfort nausea or abdominal distress dizziness or lightheadedness derealization or depersonalization fear of losing control or going crazy fear of dying paresthesias and chills or hot flushes attacks that meet all other criteria but that have fewer than 4 somatic or cognitive symptoms are referred to as limited-symptom attacks
individuals seeking care for unexpected panic attacks will usually describe the fear as intense and report that they thought they were about to die lose control have a heart attack or stroke or go crazy they also usually report an urgent desire to flee from wherever the attack is occurring with recurrent attacks some of the intense fearfulness may wane shortness of breath is a common symptom in panic attacks associated with panic disorder with and without agoraphobia blushing is common in situationally bound panic attacks related to social or performance anxiety the anxiety that is characteristic of a panic attack can be differentiated from generalized anxiety by its intermittent almost paroxysmal nature and its typically greater severity
panic attacks can occur in a variety of anxiety disorderspanic disorder social phobia specific phobia posttraumatic stress disorder acute stress disorder in determining the differential diagnostic significance of a panic attack it is important to consider the context in which the panic attack occurs there are three characteristic types of panic attacks with different relationships between the onset of the attack and the presence or absence of situational triggers unexpected uncued panic attacks
in which the onset of the panic attack is not associated with a situational trigger ie occurring spontaneously out of the blue situationally bound cued panic attacks in which the panic attack almost invariably occurs immediately on exposure to or in anticipation of the situational cue or triggerseeing a snake or dog always triggers an immediate panic attack and situationally predisposed panic attacks which are more likely to occur on exposure to the situational cue or trigger but are not invariably associated with the cue and do not necessarily occur immediately after the exposureattacks are more likely to occur while driving but there are times when the individual drives and does not have a panic attack or times when the panic attack occurs after driving for a half hour
the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks is required for a diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia situationally bound panic attacks are most characteristic of social and specific phobias situationally predisposed panic attacks are especially frequent in panic disorder but may at times occur in specific phobia or social phobia the differential diagnosis of panic attacks is complicated by the fact that an exclusive relationship does not always exist between the diagnosis and the type ofpanic attack for instance although panic disorder definitionally requires that at least some of the panic attacks be unexpected individuals with panic disorder frequently report having situationally bound attacks particularly later in the course of the disorder the diagnostic issues for boundary cases are discussed in the differential diagnosis sections of the texts for the disorders in which panic attacks may appear

a goraphobia
because agoraphobia occurs in the context of panic disorder with agoraphobia and agoraphobia without history of panic disorder the text and criteria set for agoraphobia are provided separately in this section the essential feature of agoraphobia is anxiety about being in places or situationsfrom which escape might be difficult or embarrassing or in which help may not be available in the event of having a panic attack see p 394 or panic-like symptomsfear of having a sudden attack of dizziness or a sudden attack of diarrhea criterion a the anxiety typically leads to a pervasive avoidance of a variety of situations that may include being alone outside the home or being home alone being in a crowd of people traveling in a automobile bus or airplane or being on a bridge or in an elevator some individuals are able to expose themselves to the feared situations but endure these experiences with considerable dread often an individual is better able to confront a feared situation when accompanied by a companion criterion b individuals' avoidance of situations may impair their ability to travel to work or to carry out homemaking responsibilitiesgrocery shopping taking children to the doctor the anxiety or phobic avoidance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder criterion c the differential diagnosis to distinguish agora- phobia from social and specific phobia and from severe separation anxiety disorder can be difficult because all of these conditions are characterized by avoidance of specific situations the diagnostic issues for boundary cases are discussed in the differential diagnosis sections of the texts for the disorders in which avoidant behavior is an essential or associated feature

panic disorder

the essential feature of panic disorder is the presence of recurrent unexpected panic attacks see p 394 followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks or a significant behavioral change related to the attacks criterion a the panic attacks are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substancecaffeine intoxication or a general medical conditionhyperthyroidism criterion c finally the panic attacks are not better accounted for by another mental disorderspecific or social phobia obsessive-compulsive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder or separation anxiety disorder criterion d depending on whether criteria are also met for agoraphobia see p 396 30021 panic disorder with agoraphobia or 30001 panic disorder without agoraphobia is diagnosed criterionb
an unexpected spontaneous uncued panic attack is defined as one that is not associated with a situational trigger ie it occurs out of the blue at least two unexpected panic attacks are required for the diagnosis but most individuals have considerably more individuals with panic disorder frequently also have situationally predisposed panic attacks ie those more likely to occur on but not invariably associated with exposure to a situational trigger situationallybound attacks ie those that occur almost invariably and immediately on exposure to a situational trigger can occur but are less common
the frequency and severity of the panic attacks vary widely for example some individuals have moderately frequent attacksonce a week that occur regularly for months at a time others report short bursts of more frequent attacksdaily for a week separated by weeks or months without any attacks or with less frequent attackstwo each month over many years limited-symptom attacks ie attacks that are identical to full panic attacks except that the sudden fear or anxiety is accompanied by fewer than 4 of the 13 additional symptoms are very common in individuals with panic disorder although the distinction between full panic attacks and limited-symptom attacks is somewhat arbitrary full panic attacks are associated with greater morbidity most individuals who have limited-symptom attacks have had full panic attacks at some time during the course of the disorderindividuals with panic disorder display characteristic concerns or attributions aboutpanic disorder 397
398 anxiety disorders
the implications or consequences of the panic attacks some fear that the attacks indicate the presence of an undiagnosed life-threatening illnesscardiac disease seizure disorder despite repeated medical testing and reassurance they may remain frightened and unconvinced that they do not have a life-threatening illness others fear that the panic attacks are an indication that they are going crazy or losing control or are emotionally weak some individuals with recurrent panic attacks significantly change their behaviorquit a job in response to the attacks but deny either fear of having another attack or concerns about the consequences of their panic attacks concerns about the next attack or its implications are often associated with development of avoidant behavior that may meet criteria for agoraphobia see p 396 in which case panic disorder with agoraphobia is diagnosed
associated features and disorders
a ssociated descriptive features and m ental disorders in addition to worry about panic attacks and their implications many individuals with panic disorder also report constant or intermittent feelings of anxiety that are not focused on any specific situation or event others become excessively apprehensive about the outcome of routine activities and experiences particularly those related to health or separation from loved ones for example individuals with panic disorder often anticipate a catastrophic outcome from a mild physical symptom or medication side effectthinking that a headache indicates a brain tumor or a hypertensive crisis such individuals are also much less tolerant of medication side effects and generally need continued reassurance in order to take medication in individuals whose panic disorder has not been treated or was misdiagnosed the belief that they have an undetected life-threatening illness may lead to both chronic debilitatinganxiety and excessive visits to health care facilities this pattern can be both emotionally and financially disruptive
in some cases loss or disruption of important interpersonal relationshipsleaving home to live on one's own divorce is associated with the onset or exacerbation of panic disorder demoralization is a common consequence with many individuals becoming discouraged ashamed and unhappy about the difficulties of carrying out their normal routines they often attribute this problem to a lack of strength or character this demoralization can become generalized to areas beyond specific panic-related problems these individuals may frequently be absent from work or school for doctor and emergency-room visits which can lead to unemployment or dropping out of school
major depressive disorder occurs frequently 50%-65% in individuals with panic disorder in approximately one-third of individuals with both disorders the depression precedes the onset of panic disorder in the remaining two-thirds depression occurs coincident with or following the onset of panic disorder a subset of individuals some of whom may develop a substance-related disorder as a consequence treat their anxiety with alcohol or medications comorbidity with other anxiety disorders is also common especially in clinical settings and in individuals with more severe agoraphobia social phobia has been reported in 15%-30% of individuals with panic disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder in 8%-10% specific phobia in 10%-20% and generalized anxiety disorder in 25% separation anxiety disorder in childhood has been associated with this disorder
associated laboratory findings no laboratory findings have been identified that are diagnostic of panic disorder however a variety of laboratory findings have been noted to be abnormal in groups of individuals with panic disorder relative to control
subjects some individuals with panic disorder show signs of compensated respiratory alkalosis ie decreased carbon dioxide and decreased bicarbonate levels with an almost normal ph panic attacks in response to sodium lactate infusion or carbon dioxide inhalation are more common in panic disorder than in other anxiety disorders
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
transient tachycardia and moderate elevation of systolic blood pressure may occur during some panic attacks although studies have suggested that both mitral valve prolapse and thyroid disease are more common among individuals with panic disorder than in the general population others have found no differences in prevalence
specific culture and gender features
in some cultures panic attacks may involve intense fear of witchcraft or magic panic disorder as described here has been found in epidemiological studies throughout the world moreover a number of conditions included in the glossary of culture-bound syndromes see appendix i may be related to panic disorder some cultural or ethnic groups restrict the participation of women in public life and this must be distinguished from agoraphobia panic disorder without agoraphobia is diagnosed twice as often and panic disorder with agoraphobia three times as often in women as in men
prevalence
epidemiological studies throughout the world consistently indicate the lifetime preva- lence of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia to be between 15% and 3-5% one-year prevalence rates are between 1%and 2%approximately one-third to one-half of individuals diagnosed with panic disorder in community samples also have agora- phobia although a much higher rate of agoraphobia is encountered in clinical samples
course
age at onset for panic disorder varies considerably but is most typically between late adolescence and the mid-30s there may be a bimodal distribution with one peak in late adolescence and a second smaller peak in the mid-30s a small number of cases begin in childhood and onset after age 45 years is unusual but can occur retrospective descriptions by individuals seen in clinical settings suggest that the usual course is chronic but waxing and waning some individuals may have episodic outbreaks with years of remission in between and others may have continuous severe symptomatology although agoraphobia may develop at any point its onset is usually within the first year of occurrence of recurrent panic attacks the course of agoraphobia and its relationship to the course of panic attacks are variable in some cases a decrease or remission of panic attacks may be followed closely by a corresponding decrease in agoraphobic avoidance and anxiety in others agoraphobia may become chronic regardless of the presence or absence of panic attacks some individuals report that they can reduce the frequency of panic attacks by avoiding certain situations naturalistic follow-up studies of individuals treated in tertiary care settings which may select for a poor-prognosis group suggest that at 6-10 years posttreatment about 30% of individuals are well 40%-50% are improved but symptomatic and the remaining 20%-30% have symptoms that are the same or slightly worsepanic disorder 399
400 anxiety disorders
familial pattern
first-degree biological relatives of individuals with panic disorder have a four to seven times greater chance of developing panic disorder however in clinical settings as many as one-half to three-quarters of individuals with panic disorder do not have an affected first-degree biological relative twin studies indicate a genetic contribution to the development of panic disorder
differential diagnosis
panic disorder is not diagnosed if the panic attacksare judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition in which case an anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition is diagnosed see p 436 examples of general medical conditions that can cause panic attacks include hyperthyroidism hyperparathyroidism pheochromocytoma vestibular dysfunctions seizure disorders and cardiac conditionsarrhythmias supraventricular tachycardia appropriate laboratory testsserum calcium levels for hyperparathyroidism or physical examinationsfor cardiac conditions may be helpful in determining the etiological role of a general medical condition panic disorder is not diagnosed if the panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a substance ie a drug of abuse a medication in which case a substance-induced anxiety disorder is diagnosed see p 439 intoxication with central nervous system stimulantscocaine amphetamines caffeine or cannabis and withdrawal from central nervous system depressantsalcohol barbiturates can precipitate a panic attack however if panic attacks continue to occur outside of the context of substance uselong after the effects of intoxication or withdrawal have ended a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered features such as onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attackvertigo loss of consciousness loss of bladder or bowel control headaches slurred speech or amnesia suggest the possibility that a general medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms
panic disorder must be distinguished from other mental disordersother anxiety disorders andpsychotic disorders that have panic attacksas an associated feature by definition panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected spon- taneous uncued out of the blue panic attacks as discussed earlier see p 394 there are three types of panic attacksâ€”unexpected situationally bound and situationally predisposed the presence of recurrent unexpected panic attacks either initially or later in the course is required for the diagnosis of panic disorder in contrast panicattacks that occur in the context of other anxiety disorders are situationally bound or situationally predisposedin social phobia cued by social situations in specific phobia cued by an object or situation in obsessive-compulsive disorder cued by exposure to the object of an obsession [eg exposure to dirt in someone with an obsession about contamination] in posttraumatic stress disorder cued by stimuli recalling the stressor
the focus of the anxiety also helps to differentiate panic disorder with agoraphobia from other disorders characterized by avoidant behaviors agoraphobic avoidance is associated with the fear of having a panic attack whereas avoidance in other disorders is associated with specific situationsfears of scrutiny humiliation and embarrassment in social phobia fears of heights elevators or crossing bridges in specific phobia separation concerns in separation anxiety disorder persecution fears in delusional disorder
differentiation of specific phobia situational type from panic disorder with agoraphobia may be particularly difficult because both disorders may include panic attacks and avoidance of similar types of situationsdriving flying public transportation enclosed places prototypically panic disorder with agoraphobia is characterized by the initial onset of unexpected panic attacks and the subsequent avoidance of multiple situations thought to be likely triggers of the panic attacks prototypically specific phobia situational type is characterized by situational avoid- ance in the absence of recurrent unexpected panic attacks some presentations fall between these prototypes and require clinical judgment in the selection of the most appropriate diagnosis four factors can be helpful in making this judgment the focus of fear the type and number of panic attacks the number of situations avoided and the level of intercurrent anxiety for example an individual who had not previously feared or avoided elevators has a panic attack in an elevator and begins to dread going to work because of the need to take the elevator to his office on the 24th floor if this individual subsequently has panic attacks only in elevators even if the focus of fear is on the panic attack then a diagnosis of specific phobia may be appropriate if however the individual experiences unexpected panic attacks in other situations and begins to avoid or endure with dread other situations because of fear of a panic attack then a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia would be warranted furthermore the presence of pervasive apprehension about having a panic attack even when not anticipating exposure to a phobic situation also supports a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia if the individual has additional unexpected panic attacks in other situations but no additional avoidance or endurance with dread develops then the appropriate diagnosis would be panic disorder without agoraphobia if the focus of avoidance is not related to having a panic attack but concerns some other catastropheinjury due to the elevator cable breaking then an additional diagnosis of specific phobia may be considered
similarly distinguishing between social phobia and panic disorder with agorapho- bia can be difficult especially when there is avoidance only of social situations the focus of fear and the type of panic attacks can be helpful in making this distinction for example an individual who had not previously had a fear of public speaking has a panic attack while giving a talk and begins to dread giving presentations if thisindividual subsequently has panic attacks only in social performance situations even if the focus of fear is on the possibility of having another panic attack then a diagnosis of social phobia may be appropriate if however the individual continues to experience unexpected panic attacks in other situations then a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia would be warranted individuals with social phobia fear scrutiny and rarely have a panic attack when alone whereas individuals with panic disorder with agoraphobia may be more anxious in situations where they must be without a trusted companion in addition nocturnal panic attacks that awaken an individual from sleep are characteristic of panic disorder
when criteria are met for both panic disorder and another anxiety or mood disorder both disorders should be diagnosed however if unexpected panic attacks occur in the context of another disordermajor depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder but are not accompanied by a month or more of fear of having additional attacks associated concerns or behavior change the additional diagnosis of panic disorder is not made because individualswith panic disorder may self-medicate their symptoms comorbid substance-related disorders most notably related to cannabis alcohol and cocaine are not uncommonpanic disorder 401

30022 agoraphobia withouthistoryof panic disorder

the essential features of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder are similar to those of panic disorder with agoraphobia except that the focus of fear is on the occurrence of incapacitating or extremely embarrassing panic-like symptoms or limited- symptom attacks rather than full panic attacks individuals with this disorder have agoraphobia see p 396 criterion a the panic-like symptoms include any of the 13 symptoms listed for panic attack see p 394 or other symptoms that may be incapacitating or embarrassingloss of bladder control for example an individual may be afraid to leave home because of a fear of becoming dizzy fainting and then being left helpless on the ground to qualify for this diagnosis the full criteria for panic disorder must never have been met criterion b and the symptoms must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substancea drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition criterion c if an associated general medical condition is presenta cardiac condition the fear of being incapacitated or embarrassed by the development of symptomsfainting is clearly in excess of that usually associated with the condition criterion d
specific culture and gender features
some cultural or ethnic groups restrict the participation of women in public life and this must be distinguished from agoraphobia this disorder is diagnosed far more often in females than in males
prevalence
in clinical settings almost all individuals over 95% who present with agoraphobia also have a current diagnosis or history of panic disorder in contrast the prevalence of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder in epidemiological samples has been reported to be higher than that for panic disorder with agoraphobia however problems
404 anxiety disorders
with assessment appear to have inflated the rates reported in epidemiological studies recently individuals who were given a diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder in an epidemiological study were reevaluated by clinicians using standard interview schedules the majority were found to have specific phobias but not agoraphobia
course
relatively little is known about the course of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder anecdotal evidence suggests that some cases may persist for years and be associated with considerable impairment
differential diagnosis
agoraphobia without history of panic disorder is distinguished from panic disorder with agoraphobia by the absence of a history of recurrent unexpected panic attacks the avoidance in agoraphobia without history of panic disorder results from fear of incapacitation or humiliation due to unpredictable sudden panic-like symptoms rather than from fear of a full panic attack as in panic disorder with agoraphobia the diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia remains appropriate in cases in which panic attacks go into remission but agoraphobia continues to be experienced
other reasons for avoidance must also be distinguished from agoraphobia without history of panic disorder in social phobia individuals avoid social or performance situations in which they fear that they might act in a way that is humiliating or embarrassing in specific phobia the individual avoids a specific feared object or situation in major depressive disorder the individual may avoid leaving home due to apathy loss of energy and anhedonia persecutory fears as in delusional disorder and fears of contamination as in obsessive-compulsive disorder can also lead to widespread avoidance in separation anxiety disorder children avoid situationsthat take them away from home or close relatives
individuals with certain general medical conditions may avoid situations due to realistic concerns about being incapacitatedfainting in an individual with transient ischemic attacks or being embarrasseddiarrhea in an individual with crohn's disease the diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder should be given only if the fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that usually associated with the general medical condition

the essential feature of specific phobia is marked and persistent fear of clearly discernible circumscribed objects or situations criterion a exposure to the phobic stimulus almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response criterion b this response may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally predisposed panic attack see p 394 although adolescents and adults with this disorder recognize that their fear is excessive or unreasonable criterion c this may not be the case with children most often the phobic stimulus is avoided although it is sometimes endured with dread criterion d the diagnosis is appropriate only if the avoidance fear or anxious anticipation of encountering the phobic stimulus interferes significantly with the person's daily routine occupational functioning or social life or ifthe person ismarkedly distressed about having the phobia criterion e in individuals under age 18 years symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months before specific phobia is diagnosed criterion f the anxiety panic attacks or phobic avoidance are not better accounted for by another mental disorderobsessive-compulsive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder separation anxiety disorder social phobia panic disorder with agoraphobia or agoraphobia without history of panic disorder criterion g
the individual experiences a marked persistent and excessive or unreasonable fear when in the presence of or when anticipating an encounter with a specific object or situation the focus of the fear may be anticipated harm from some aspect of the object or situationan individual may fear air travel because of a concern about crashing may fear dogs because of concerns about being bitten or may fear driving because of concerns about being hit by other vehicles on the road specific phobias may also involve concerns about losing control panicking and fainting that might occur on exposure to the feared object for example individuals afraid of blood and injury may also worry about the possibility of fainting people afraid of heights may also worry about dizziness and people afraid of closed-in situations may also worry about losing control and screaming
anxiety is almost invariably felt immediately on confronting the phobic stimulusa person with a specific phobia of cats will almost invariably have an immediate
406 anxiety disorders
anxiety response when forced to confront a cat the level of anxiety or fear usually varies as a function of both the degree of proximity to the phobic stimulusfear intensifies as the cat approaches and decreases as the cat withdraws and the degree to which escape from the phobic stimulus is limitedfear intensifies as the elevator approaches the midway point between floors and decreases as the doors open at the next floor however the intensity of the fear may not always relate predictably to the phobic stimulusa person afraid of heights may experience variable amounts of fear when crossing the same bridge on different occasions sometimes full-blownpanic attacks are experienced in response to the phobic stimulus especially when the person must remain in the situation or believes that escape will be impossible because marked anticipatory anxiety occurs if the person is confronted with the necessity of entering into the phobic situation such situations are usually avoided less commonly the person forces himself or herself to endure the phobic situation but it is experienced with intense anxiety
adults with this disorder recognize that the phobia is excessive or unreasonable the diagnosis would be delusional disorder instead of specific phobia for an individual who avoids an elevator because of a conviction that it has been sabotaged and who does not recognize that this fear is excessive and unreasonable moreover the diagnosis should not be given if the fear is reasonable given the context of the stimulifear of being shot in a hunting area or a dangerous neighborhood insight into the excessive or unreasonable nature of the fear tends to increase with age and is not required to make the diagnosis in children
fears of circumscribed objects or situations are very common especially in children but in many cases the degree of impairment is insufficient to warrant a diagnosis if the phobia does not significantly interfere with the individual's functioning or cause marked distress the diagnosis is not made for example a person who is afraid of snakes to the point of expressing intense fear in the presence of snakes would not receive a diagnosis of specific phobia if he or she lives in an area devoid of snakes is not restricted in activities by the fear of snakes and is not distressed about having a fear of snakes
subtypes
the following subtypes may be specified to indicate the focus of fear or avoidance in specific phobiaspecific phobia animal type
animal type this subtype should be specified if the fear is cued by animals or insects this subtype generally has a childhood onset
natural environment type this subtype should be specified if the fear is cued by objects in the natural environment such as storms heights or water this subtype generally has a childhood onset
blood-injection-injury type this subtype should be specified if the fear is cued by seeing blood or an injury or by receiving an injection or other invasive medical procedure this subtype is highly familial and is often characterized by a strong vasovagal response
situational type this subtype should be specified if the fear is cued by a specific situation such as public transportation tunnels bridges elevators flying driving or enclosed places this subtype has a bimodal age-at-onset distribution with one peak in childhood and another peak in the mid-20s this subtype
appears to be similar to panic disorder with agoraphobia in its characteristic sex ratios familial aggregation pattern and age at onset
other type this subtype should be specified if the fear is cued by other stimuli these stimuli might include the fear or avoidance of situations that might lead to choking vomiting or contracting an illness space phobia ie the individual is afraid of falling down if away from walls or other means of physical support and children's fears of loud sounds or costumed characters
the frequency of the subtypes in adult clinical settings from most to least frequent is situational natural environment blood-injection-injury and animal in many cases more than one subtype of specific phobia is present having one phobia of a specific subtype tends to increase the likelihood of having another phobia from within the same subtypefear of cats and snakes when more than one subtype applies they should all be notedspecific phobia animal and natural environment types
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders specific phobia may re- sult in a restricted lifestyle or interference with certain occupations depending on the type of phobia for example job promotion may be threatened by avoidance of air travel and social activities may be restricted by fears of crowded or closed-in places specific phobias frequently co-occur with other anxiety disorders but are rarely the focus of clinical attention in these situations the specific phobia is usually associated with less distress or less interference with functioning than the comorbid main diagnosis there is a particularly frequent co-occurrence between specific phobias and panic disorder with agoraphobia
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions a
vasovagal fainting response is characteristic of blood-injection-injury type specific phobias approximately 75% of such individuals report a history of fainting in these situations the physiological response is characterized by an initial brief acceleration of heart rate followed by a deceleration of heart rate and a drop in blood pressure which contrasts with the usual acceleration of heart rate in other specific phobias certain general medical conditions may be exacerbated as a consequence of phobic avoidance for example specific phobias blood-injection-injury type may have detrimental effects on dental or physical health because the individual may avoid obtaining necessary medical care similarly fears of choking may have a detrimental effect on health when food is limited to substances that are easy to swallow or when oral medication is avoided
specific culture age and gender features
the content of phobias as well as their prevalence varies with culture and ethnicity for example fears of magic or spirits are present in many cultures and should be considered a specific phobia only if the fear is excessive in the context of that culture and causes significant impairment or distressin children the anxiety may be expressed by crying tantrums freezing or clinging children often do not recognize that the fears are excessive or unreasonable and rarely30029 specific phobia 407
408 anxiety disorders
report distress about having the phobias fears of animals and other objects in the natural environment are particularly common and are usually transitory in childhood a diagnosis of specific phobia is not warranted unless the fears lead to clinically significant impairmentunwillingness to go to school for fear of encountering a dog on the street
the sex ratio varies across different types of specific phobias approximately 75%-90% of individuals with the animal and natural environment type are female except for fear of heights where the percentage of females is 55%-70% similarly approximately 75%-90% of individuals with the situational type are female approxi- mately 55%-70% of individualswith the blood-injection-injury type are female
prevalence
although phobias are common in the general population they rarely result in sufficient impairment or distress to warrant a diagnosis of specific phobia the reported prevalence may vary depending on the threshold used to determine impairment or distress and the number of types of phobias surveyed in community samples a 1-year prevalence rate of about 9% has been reported with lifetime rates ranging from 10% to 113%
course
the mean age at onset varies according to the type of specific phobia age at onset for specific phobia situational type tends to be bimodally distributed with a peak in childhood and a second peak in the mid-20s specific phobias natural environment typeheight phobia tend to begin primarily in childhood although many new cases of height phobia develop in early adulthood the ages at onset for specific phobias animal type and for specific phobias blood-injection-injury type are also usuallyin childhood
predisposing factors to the onset of specific phobias include traumatic events such as being attacked by an animal or trapped in a closet unexpected panic attacks in the to-be-feared situation observation of others undergoing trauma or demonstrating fearfulness such as observing others fall from heights or become afraid in the presence of certain animals and informational transmissionrepeated parental warnings about the dangers of certain animals or media coverage of airplane crashes feared objects or situations tend to involve things that may actually represent a threat or have represented a threat at some point in the course of human evolution phobias that result from traumatic events or unexpected panic attacks tend to be particularly acute in their development phobias of traumatic origin do not have a characteristic age at onsetfear of choking which usually follows a choking or near-choking incident may develop at almost any age phobias that persist into adulthood remit only infrequently around 20% of cases
familial pattern
preliminary evidence suggests that there may be an aggregation within families by type of phobiafirst-degree biological relatives of persons with specific phobias animal type are likely to have animal phobias although not necessarily of the same animal and first-degree biological relatives of persons with specific phobias situational type
30029 specific phobia 409 are likely to have phobias of situations fears of blood and injury have particularly
strong familial patterns
differential diagnosis
specific phobias differ from most other anxietydisorders in levels of intercurrentanxiety typically individuals with specific phobia unlike those with panic disorder with agoraphobia do not present with pervasive anxiety because their fear is limited to specific circumscribed objects or situations however generalized anxious anticipation may emerge under conditions in which encounters with the phobic stimulus become more likelywhen a person who is fearful of snakes moves to a desert area or when life events force immediate confrontation with the phobic stimuluswhen a person who is fearful of flying is forced by circumstances to fly
differentiation of specific phobia situational type from panic disorder with agoraphobia may be particularly difficult because both disorders may include panic attacks and avoidance of similar types of situationsdriving flying public transportation and enclosed places prototypically panic disorder with agoraphobia is characterized by the initial onset of unexpected panic attacks and the subsequent avoidance of multiple situations thought to be likely triggers of the panic attacks prototypically specific phobia situational type is characterized by situational avoid- ance in the absence of recurrent unexpected panic attacks some presentations fall between these prototypes and require clinical judgment in the selection of the most appropriate diagnosis four factors can be helpful in making this judgment the focus of fear the type and number of panic attacks the number of situations avoided and the level of intercurrent anxiety for example an individual who had not previously feared or avoided elevators has a panic attack in an elevator and begins to dread going to work because of the need to take the elevator to his office on the 24th floor if this individual subsequently has panic attacks only in elevators even if the focus of fear is on the panic attack then a diagnosis of specific phobia may be appropriate if however the individual experiences unexpected panic attacks in other situations and begins to avoid or endure with dread other situations because of fear of a panic attack then a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia would be warranted furthermore the presence of pervasive apprehension about having a panic attack even when not anticipating exposure to a phobic situation also supports a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia if the individual has additional unexpected panic attacks in other situations but no additional avoidance or endurance with dread develops then the appropriate diagnosis would be panic disorder without agoraphobia
concurrent diagnoses of specific phobia and panic disorder with agoraphobia are sometimes warranted in these cases consideration of the focus of the individual's concern about the phobic situation may be helpful for example avoidance of being alone because of concern about having unexpected panic attacks warrants a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia if other criteria are met whereas the additional phobic avoidance of air travel if due to worries about bad weather conditions and crashing may warrant an additional diagnosis of specific phobia
specific phobia and social phobia can be differentiated on the basis of the focus of the fears for example avoidance of eating in a restaurantmay be based on concerns about negative evaluation from others ie social phobia or concerns about choking ie specific phobia in contrast to the avoidance in specific phobia the avoidance in

the differentiation between hypochondriasis and a specific phobia other type ie avoidance of situations that may lead to contracting an illness depends on the presence or absence of disease conviction individuals with hypochondriasis are preoccupied with fears of having a disease whereas individuals with a specific phobia fear contracting a disease but do not believe it is already present in individuals with a norexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa a diagnosis of specific phobia is not given if the avoidance behavior is exclusively limited to avoidance of food and food-related cues an individual with schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder may avoid certain activities in response to delusions but does not recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable
fears are very common particularly in childhood but they do not warrant a diagnosis of specific phobia unless there is significant interference with social educa- tional or occupational functioning or marked distress about having the phobia

30023 social phobia social anxietydisorder

the essential feature of social phobia is a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur criterion a exposure to the social or performance situation almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response criterion b this response may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally predisposed panic attack see p 394 although adolescents and adults with this disorder recognize that their fear is excessive or unreasonable criterion c this may not be the case with children most often the social or performance situation is avoided although it is sometimes endured with dread criterion d the diagnosis is appropriate only if the avoidance fear or anxious anticipation of encountering the social or performance situation interferes significantly with the person's daily routine occupa- tional functioning or social life or if the person is markedly distressed about having the phobia criterion e in individuals younger than age 18 years symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months before social phobia is diagnosed criterion f the fear or avoidance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition and is not better accounted for by another mental disorderpanic disorder separation anxiety disorder body dysmorphic disorder a pervasive devel- opmental disorder or schizoid personality disorder criterion g if another mental30023 social phobia 411

in feared social or performance situations individuals with social phobia experience concerns about embarrassment and are afraid that others will judge them to be anxious weak crazy or stupid they may fear public speaking because of concern that others will notice their trembling hands or voice or they may experience extreme anxiety when conversing with others because of fear that they will appear inarticulate they may avoid eating drinking or writing in public because of a fear of being embarrassed by having others see their hands shake individuals with social phobia almost always experience symptoms of anxietypalpitations tremors sweating gastrointestinal discomfort diarrhea muscle tension blushing confusion in the feared social situations and in severe cases these symptoms may meet the criteria for a panic attack see p 395 blushing may be more typical of social phobia
adults with social phobia recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable although this is not always the case in children for example the diagnosis would be delusional disorder instead of social phobia for an individual who avoids eating in public because of a conviction that he or she will be observed by the police and who does not recognize that this fear is excessive and unreasonable moreover the diagnosis should not be given if the fear is reasonable given the context of the stimulifear of being called on in class when unprepared
the person with social phobia typically will avoid the feared situations less commonly the person forces himself or herself to endure the social or performance situation but experiences it with intense anxiety marked anticipatory anxiety may also occur far in advance of upcoming social or public situationsworrying every day for several weeks before attending a social event there may be a vicious cycle of anticipatory anxiety leading to fearful cognition and anxiety symptoms in the feared situations which leads to actual or perceived poor performance in the fearedsituations which leads to embarrassment and increased anticipatory anxiety about the feared situations and so on
the fear or avoidance must interfere significantly with the person's normal routine occupational or academic functioning or social activities or relationships or the person must experience marked distress about having the phobia for example a person who is afraid of speaking in public would not receive a diagnosis of social phobia if this activity is not routinely encountered in job or classroom and the person is not particularly distressed about it fears of being embarrassed in social situations are common but usually the degree of distress or impairment is insufficient to warrant a diagnosis of social phobia transient social anxiety or avoidance is especially common in childhood and adolescencean adolescent girl may avoid eating in front of boys for a short time then resume usual behavior in those younger than age 18 years only symptoms that persist for at least 6 months qualify for the diagnosis of social phobia
specifier
generalized this specifier can be used when the fears are related to most social situationsinitiating or maintaining conversations participating in small groups dating speaking to authority figures attending partiesindividuals with social phobia generalized usually fear both public performance situations
and social interactional situations because individuals with social phobia often do not spontaneously report the full range of their social fears it is useful for the clinician to review a list of social and performance situations with the individual individuals whose clinical manifestationsdo not meet the definition of general- ized compose a heterogeneous group that includes persons who fear a single performance situation as well as those who fear several but not most social situations individuals with social phobia generalized may be more likely to manifest deficits in social skills and to have severe social and work impairment
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders common associated fea- tures of social phobia include hypersensitivity to criticism negative evaluation or rejection difficulty being assertive and low self-esteem or feelings of inferiority individuals with social phobia also often fear indirect evaluation by others such as taking a test they may manifest poor social skillspoor eye contact or observable signs of anxietycold clammy hands tremors shaky voice individuals with social phobia often underachieve in school due to test anxiety or avoidance of classroom participation they may underachieve at work because of anxiety during or avoidance of speaking in groups in public or to authority figures and colleagues persons with social phobia often have decreased social support networks and are less likely to marry in more severe cases individuals may drop out of school be unemployed and not seek work due to difficulty interviewing for jobs have no friends or cling to unfulfilling relationships completely refrain from dating or remain with their family of origin
social phobia may be associated with panic disorder with agoraphobia agorapho- bia without history of panic disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder mood disorders substance-related disorders and somatization disorder and usually precedes these disorders in clinical samples avoidant personality disorder is frequently present in individuals with social phobia generalized
associated laboratory findings compared with those with panic disorder individ-
uals with social phobia are less likely to develop a panic attack in response to sodium lactate infusion or carbon dioxide inhalation this finding supports the differentiation of social phobia from panic disorder although none of these findings are considered to be diagnostic of these disorders
specific culture age and gender features
clinical presentation and resulting impairmentmay differ across cultures depending on social demands in certain cultures egjapan and korea individualswith social phobia may develop persistent and excessive fears of giving offense to others in social situations instead of being embarrassed these fears may take the form of extreme anxiety that blushing eye-to-eye contact or one's body odor will be offensive to others taijin kyofusho in japan
in children crying tantrums freezing clinging or staying close to a familiar person and inhibited interactions to the point of mutism may be present young children may appear excessively timid in unfamiliar social settings shrink from contact with others refuse to participate in group play typically stay on the periphery of social activities30023 social phobia 413
4l4 anxiety disorders
and attempt to remain close to familiar adults unlike adults children with social phobia usually do not have the option of avoiding feared situations altogether and may be unable to identify the nature of their anxiety there may be a decline in classroom performance school refusal or avoidance of age-appropriate social activities and dating to make the diagnosis in children there must be evidence of capacity for social relationships with familiar people and the social anxiety must occur in peer settings not just in interactions with adults because of the disorder's early onset and chronic course impairment in children tends to take the form of failure to achieve an expected level of functioning rather than a decline from an optimal level of functioning in contrast when the onset is in adolescence the disorder may lead to decrements in social and academic performance
epidemiological and community-based studies suggest that social phobia is more common in women than in men in most clinical samples however the sexes are either equally represented or the majority are male
prevalence
epidemiological and community-based studies have reported a lifetime prevalence of social phobia ranging from 3% to 13% the reported prevalence may vary depending on the threshold used to determine distress or impairment and the number of types of social situations specifically surveyed in one study 20% reported excessive fear of public speaking and performance but only about 2% appeared to experience enough impairment or distress to warrant a diagnosis of social phobia in the general population most individuals with social phobia fear public speaking whereas somewhat less than half fear speaking to strangers or meeting new people other performance fearseating drinking or writing in public or using a public restroom appear to be less common in clinical settings the vast majority of persons with social phobia fear more than one type of social situation social phobia is rarely the reason for admission to inpatient settings in outpatient clinics rates of social phobia have ranged between 10% and 20% of individuals with anxiety disorders but rates vary widely by site
course
social phobia typically has an onset in the mid-teens sometimes emerging out of a childhood history of social inhibition or shyness some individuals report an onset in early childhood onset may abruptly follow a stressful or humiliating experience or it may be insidious the course of social phobia is often continuous duration is frequently lifelong although the disorder may attenuate in severity or remit during adulthood severity of impairment may fluctuate with life stressors and demands for example social phobia may diminish after a person with fear of dating marries and reemerge after death of a spouse a job promotion to a position requiring public speaking may result in the emergence of social phobia in someone who previously never needed to speak in publicfamilial patternsocial phobia appears to occur more frequently among first-degree biological relatives of those with the disorder compared with the general population
differential diagnosis
individuals with both panic attacksand social avoidance sometimes present a potentially difficult diagnostic problem prototypically panic disorder with agoraphobia is characterized by the initial onset of unexpected panic attacks and the subsequent avoidance of multiple situations thought to be likely triggers of the panic attacks although social situations may be avoided in panic disorder due to the fear of being seen while having a panic attack panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unex- pected panic attacks that are not limited to social situations and the diagnosis of social phobia is not made when the only social fear is of being seen while having a panic attackprototypicallysocialphobiaischaracterizedbytheavoidance ofsocialsituations in the absence of recurrent unexpected panic attacks when panic attacks do occur they take the form of situationallybound or situationally predisposed panic attackseg a person with fear of embarrassment when speaking in public experiences panic attacks cued only by public speaking or other social situations some presentations fall between these prototypes and require clinical judgment in the selection of the most appropriate diagnosis for example an individual who had not previously had a fear of public speaking has a panic attack while giving a talk and begins to dread giving presentations if this individual subsequently has panic attacks only in social performance situations even if the focus of fear is on the panic then a diagnosis of social phobia may be appropriate if however the individual continues to experience unexpected panic attacks then a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia would be warranted if criteria are met for both social phobia and panic disorder both diagnoses may be given for example an individual with lifelong fear and avoidance of most social situations social phobia later develops panic attacks in nonsocial situations and a variety of additional avoidance behaviors panic disorder with agoraphobia
avoidance of situations because of a fear of possible humiliation is highly prominent in social phobia but may also at times occur in panic disorder with agoraphobia and agoraphobia without history of panic disorder the situations avoided in social phobia are limited to those involving possible scrutiny by other people fears in agoraphobia without history of panic disorder typically involve characteristic clusters of situations that may or may not involve scrutiny by othersbeing alone outside the home or being home alone being on a bridge or in an elevator traveling in abus train automobile or airplane the role of a companion also may be useful in distinguishing social phobia from agoraphobia with and without panic disorder typically individuals with agoraphobic avoidance prefer to be with a trusted companion when in the feared situation whereas individuals with social phobia may have marked anticipatory anxiety but characteristicallydo not have panic attacks when alone a person with social phobia who fears crowded stores would feel scrutinized with or without a companion and might be less anxious without the added burden of perceived scrutiny by the companion
children with separation anxiety disorder may avoid social settings due to concerns about being separated from their caretaker concerns about being embarrassed by needing to leave prematurely to return home or concerns about requiring the presence of a parent when it is not developmentally appropriate a separate diagnosis of social phobia is generally not warranted children with separation anxiety disorder are usually comfortable in social settings in their own home whereas those with social phobia display signs of discomfort even when feared social situations occur at homealthough fear of embarrassment or humiliation may be present in generalized30023 social phobia 415

in a pervasive developmental disorder and schizoid personality disorder social situations are avoided because of lack of interest in relating to other individuals in contrast individuals with social phobia have a capacity for and interest in social relationships with familiar people in particularfor children to qualify for a diagnosis of social phobia they must have at least one age-appropriate social relationship with someone outside the immediate familya child who feels uncomfortable in social gatherings with peers and avoids such situations but who has an active interest in and a relationship with one familiar same-age friend
avoidant personality disorder shares a number of features with social phobia and appears to overlap extensively with social phobia generalized for individuals with social phobia generalized the additional diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder should be considered
social anxiety and avoidance of social situations are associated features of many other mental disordersmajor depressive disorder dysthymic disorder schizo- phrenia body dysmorphic disorder if the symptoms of social anxiety or avoidance occur only during the course of another mental disorder and are judged to be better accounted for by that disorder the additional diagnosis of social phobia is not made
individuals with social phobia may be vulnerable to a worsening of social anxiety and avoidance related to a general medical condition or mental disorder with potentially embarrassing symptomstremor in parkinson's disease abnormal eating behavior in anorexia nervosa obesity strabismus or facial scarring however if social anxiety and avoidance are limited to concerns about the general medical condition or mental disorder by convention the diagnosis of social phobia is not made if the social avoidance is clinically significant a separate diagnosis of anxiety disorder not otherwise specified may be given
performance anxiety stage fright and shyness in social situations that involve unfamiliar people are common and should not be diagnosed as social phobia unless the anxiety or avoidance leads to clinically significant impairment or marked distress children commonly exhibit social anxiety particularly when interactingwith unfamiliar adults a diagnosis of social phobia should not be made in children unless the social anxiety is also evident in peer settings and persists for at least 6 months

3003 obsessive-compulsive disorder

the essential features of obsessive-compulsive disorder are recurrent obsessions or compulsions criterion a that are severe enough to be time consuming ie they take more than 1 hour a day or cause marked distress or significant impairment criterion c at some point during the course of the disorder the person has recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable criterion b if another axis i disorder is present the content of the obsessions or compulsions is not restricted to it
418 anxiety disorders
criterion d the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substancea drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition criterion e
obsessions are persistent ideas thoughts impulses or images that are experienced as intrusive and inappropriate and that cause marked anxiety or distress the intrusive and inappropriate quality of the obsessions has been referred to as ego-dystonic this refers to the individual's sense that the content of the obsession is alien not within his or her own control and not the kind of thought that he or she would expect to have however the individual is able to recognize that the obsessions are the product of his or her own mind and are not imposed from without as in thought insertion
the most common obsessions are repeated thoughts about contaminationbecoming contaminated by shaking hands repeated doubtswondering whether one has performed some act such as having hurt someone in a traffic accident or having left a door unlocked a need to have things in a particular orderintense distress when objects are disordered or asymmetrical aggressive or horrific impulsesto hurt one's child or to shout an obscenity in church and sexual imagerya recurrent pornographic image the thoughts impulses or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problemsconcerns about current ongoing difficulties in life such as financial work or school problems and are unlikely to be related to a real-life problem
the individual with obsessions usually attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts or impulses or to neutralize them with some other thought or action ie a compulsion for example an individual plagued by doubts about having turned off the stove attempts to neutralize them by repeatedly checking to ensure that it is off
compulsions are repetitive behaviorshand washing ordering checking or mental actspraying counting repeating words silently the goal of which is to prevent or reduce anxiety or distress not to provide pleasure or gratification in most cases the person feels driven to perform the compulsion to reduce the distress that accompanies an obsession or to prevent some dreaded event or situation for example individuals with obsessions about being contaminated may reduce their mental distress by washing their hands until their skin is raw individuals distressed by obsessions about having left a door unlocked may be driven to check the lock every few minutes individuals distressed by unwanted blasphemous thoughts may find relief in counting to 10 backward and forward 100 times for each thought in some cases individuals perform rigid or stereotyped acts according to idiosyncraticallyelaborated rules without being able to indicate why they are doing them by definition compulsions are either clearly excessive or are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent the most common compulsions involve washing and cleaning counting checking requesting or demanding assurances repeating actions and ordering
by definition adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder have at some point recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable this requirement does not apply to children because they may lack sufficient cognitive awareness to make this judgment however even in adults there is a broad range of insight into the reasonableness of the obsessions or compulsions some individuals are uncertain about the reasonableness of their obsessions or compulsions and any given individual's insight may vary across times and situations for example the person may recognize a contamination compulsion as unreasonable when discussing it in a safe situationin the therapist's office but not when forced to handle money at those times when the individual recognizes that the obsessions and compulsions are unrea-

sonable he or she may desire or attempt to resist them when attempting to resist a compulsion the individual may have a sense of mounting anxiety or tension that is often relieved by yielding to the compulsion in the course of the disorder after repeated failure to resist the obsessions or compulsions the individual may give in to them no longer experience a desire to resist them and may incorporate the compulsions into his or her daily routines
the obsessions or compulsions must cause marked distress be time consuming take more than 1 hour per day or significantly interfere with the individual's normal routine occupational functioning or usual social activities or relationships with others obsessions or compulsions can displace useful and satisfying behavior and can be highly disruptive to overall functioning because obsessive intrusions can be distracting they frequently result in inefficient performance of cognitive tasks that require concentration such as reading or computation in addition many individuals avoid objects or situations that provoke obsessions or compulsions such avoidance can become extensive and can severely restrict general functioning
specifier
with poor insight this specifier can be applied when for most of the time during the current episode the individual does not recognize that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders frequently there is avoid- ance of situations that involve the content of the obsessions such as dirt or contamina- tion for example a person with obsessions about dirt may avoid public restrooms or shaking hands with strangers hypochondriacal concerns are common with repeated visits to physicians to seek reassurance guilt a pathological sense of responsibility and sleep disturbances may be present there may be excessive use of alcohol or of sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic medications performing compulsions may become a major life activity leading to serious marital occupational or social disability pervasive avoidance may leave an individual housebound
obsessive-compulsive disorder may be associated with major depressive disorder other anxiety disorders specific phobia social phobia panic disorder eating disor- ders and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder there is a high incidence of obsessive-compulsive disorder in individuals with tourette's disorder with estimates ranging from approximately 35% to 50%the incidence of tourette's disorder in obsessive-compulsive disorder is lower with estimates ranging between 5% and 7% between 20%and 30%of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder have reported current or past tics
associated laboratory findings no laboratory findings have been identified that are diagnostic of obsessive-compulsive disorder however a variety of laboratory findings have been noted to be abnormal in groups of individuals with obsessive- compulsive disorder relative to control subjects there is some evidence that some serotonin agonists given acutely cause increased symptoms in some individuals with the disorder individuals with the disorder may exhibit increased autonomic activity when
420 anxiety disorders
confronted in the laboratory with circumstances that trigger an obsession physiological reactivity decreases after the performance of compulsions
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
dermatological problems caused by excessive washing with water or caustic cleaning agents may be observed
specific culture age and gender features
culturally prescribed ritual behavior is not in itself indicative of obsessive-compulsive disorder unless it exceeds cultural norms occurs at times and places judged inappro- priate by others of the same culture and interferes with social role functioning important life transitions and mourning may lead to an intensificationof ritual behavior that may appear to be an obsession to a clinician who is not familiar with the cultural context
presentations of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children are generally similar to those in adulthood washing checking and ordering rituals are particularly common in children children generally do not request help and the symptoms may not be ego-dystonic more often the problem is identified by parents who bring the child in for treatment gradual declines in schoolwork secondary to impaired ability to concen- trate have been reported like adults children are more prone to engage in rituals at home than in front of peers teachers or strangers
this disorder is equally common in males and females
prevalence
although obsessive-compulsive disorder was previously thought to be relatively rare in the general population recent community studies have estimated a lifetime prevalence of 25%and 1-year prevalence of 15%-21%
course
although obsessive-compulsive disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult- hood it may begin in childhood modal age at onset is earlier in males than in females between ages 6 and 15 years for males and between ages 20 and 29 years for females for the most part onset is gradual but acute onset has been noted in some cases the majority of individuals have a chronic waxing and waning course with exacerbation of symptoms that may be related to stress about 15% show progressive deterioration in occupational and social functioning about 5% have an episodic course with minimal or no symptoms between episodes
familial pattern
the concordance rate for obsessive-compulsive disorder is higher for monozygotic twins than it is for dizygotic twins the rate of obsessive-compulsive disorder in first-degree biological relatives of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder and in first-degree biological relatives of individuals with tourette's disorder is higher than that in the general population
3003 obsessive-compulsive disorder 421
differential diagnosis
obsessive-compulsive disorder must be distinguished from anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition the diagnosis is anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition when the obsessions or compulsions are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical condition see p 436 this determination is based on history laboratory findings or physical examination a substance-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from obsessive-compulsive disorder by the fact that a substance ie a drug of abuse a medication or exposure to a toxin is judged to be etiologically related to the obsessions or compulsions see p 439
recurrent or intrusive thoughts impulses images or behaviors may occur in the context of many other mental disorders obsessive-compulsive disorder is not diag- nosed if the content of the thoughts or the activities is exclusively related to another mental disorderpreoccupation with appearance in body dysmorphic disorder preoccupation with a feared object or situation in specific or social phobia hairpulling in trichotillomania an additional diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder may still be warranted if there are obsessions or compulsions whose content is unrelated to the other mental disorder
in a major depressive episode persistent brooding about potentially unpleasant circumstances or about possible alternative actions is common and is considered a mood-congruent aspect of depression rather than an obsession for example a depressed individual who ruminates that he is worthless would not be considered to have obsessions because such brooding is not ego-dystonic
generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive worry but such worries are distinguished from obsessions by the fact that the person experiences them as excessive concerns about real-life circumstances for example an excessive concern that one may lose one's job would constitute a worry not an obsession in contrast the content of obsessions does not typically involve real-life problems and the obsessions are experienced as inappropriate by the individualthe intrusive distressing idea that god is dog spelled backward
if recurrent distressing thoughts are exclusively related to fears of having or the idea that one has a serious disease based on misinterpretation of bodily symptoms then hypochondriasis should be diagnosed instead of obsessive-compulsive disorder however if the concern about having an illness is accompanied by rituals such as excessive washing or checking behavior related to concerns about the illness or about spreading it to other people then an additional diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder may be indicated if the major concern is about contracting an illness rather than having an illness and no rituals are involved then a specific phobia of illness may be the more appropriate diagnosis
the ability of individuals to recognize that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable occurs on a continuum in some individuals with obsessive- compulsive disorder reality testing may be lost and the obsession may reach delusional proportionsthe belief that one has caused the death of another person by having willed it in such cases the presence of psychotic features may be indicated by an additional diagnosis of delusional disorder or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified the specifier with poor insight may be useful in those situations that are on the boundary between obsession and delusionan individual whose extreme preoccupation with contamination although exaggerated is less intense than in a

delusional disorder and is justified by the fact that germs are indeed ubiquitous
the ruminativedelusional thoughts and bizarre stereotyped behaviors that occur in schizophrenia are distinguished from obsessions and compulsions by the fact that they are not ego-dystonic and not subject to reality testing however some individuals manifest symptoms of both obsessive-compulsive disorder and schizophrenia and
warrant both diagnoses
tics in tic disorder and stereotyped movements in stereotypic movement
disorder must be distinguished from compulsions a tic is a sudden rapid recurrent nonrhythmic stereotyped motor movement or vocalizationeye blinking tongue protrusion throat clearing a stereotyped movement is a repetitive seemingly driven nonfunctional motor behaviorhead banging body rocking self-biting in contrast to a compulsion tics and stereotyped movements are typicallyless complex and are not aimed at neutralizing an obsession some individuals manifest symptoms of both obsessive-compulsive disorder and a tic disorder especially tourette's disorder and both diagnoses may be warranted
some activities such as eatingeating disorders sexual behaviorparaphilias gamblingeg pathologicalgambling or substance usealcohol dependence or abuse when engaged in excessively have been referred to as compulsive however these activities are not considered to be compulsions as defined in this manual because the person usually derives pleasure from the activity and may wish to resist it only because of its deleterious consequences
although obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and obsessive- compulsive disorder have similar names the clinical manifestations of these disorders are quite different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not characterized by the presence of obsessions or compulsions and instead involves a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness perfectionism and control and must begin by early adulthood if an individual manifests symptoms of both obsessive-compulsive disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder both diagnoses can be given
superstitions andrepetitive checking behaviors are commonly encountered in everyday life a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder should be considered only if they are particularly time consuming or result in clinically significant impairment or distress

30981 posttraumatic stress disorder

the essential feature of posttraumatic stress disorder is the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor involving direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury or other threat to one's physical integrity or witnessing an event that involves death injury or a threat to the physical integrity of another person or learning about unexpected or violent death serious harm or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate criterional the person's response to the event mustinvolve intense fear helplessness or horror or in children the response must involve disorga- nized or agitated behavior criterion a2 the characteristic symptoms resulting from the exposure to the extreme trauma include persistent reexperiencing of the traumatic event criterion b persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness criterion c and persistent symptoms of increased arousal criterion d the full symptom picture must be present for more than 1 month criterion e and the disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterionf
traumatic events that are experienced directly include but are not limited to military combat violent personal assault sexual assault physical attack robbery mugging being kidnapped being taken hostage terroristattack torture incarcerationas a prisoner of war or in a concentration camp natural or manmade disasters severe automobile accidents or being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness for children sexually traumatic events may include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences without threatened or actual violence or injury witnessed events include but are not limited to observing the serious injury or unnatural death of another person due to violent assault accident war or disaster or unexpectedly witnessing a dead body or body partsevents experienced by others that are learned about include but are not limited to violent personal assault serious accident or serious injury experienced by a family member or a close friend learning about the sudden unexpected death of a family member or a close friend or learning that one's child has a life-threatening disease the disorder may be especially severe or long lasting when the stressor is of human designtorture rape the likelihood of developing this disorder may increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the stressor increase
the traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways commonly the person has recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event criterion bl or recurrent distressing dreams during which the event is replayed criterion b2 in rare instances the person experiences dissociative states that last from a few seconds to several hours or even days during which components of the event are relived and the person behaves as though experiencing the event at that moment criterion b3 intense psychological distress criterion b4 or physiological reactivity criterion b5 often occurs when the person is exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic eventanniversaries of the traumatic event cold snowy weather or uniformed guards for survivors of death camps in cold climates hot humid weather for combat veterans of the south pacific entering any elevator for a woman who was raped in an elevator

specifiers
the following specifiers may be used to specify onset and duration of the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder
acute this specifier should be used when the duration of symptoms is less than 3 months
chronic this specifier should be used when the symptoms last 3 months or longer
with delayed onset this specifier indicates that at least 6 months have passed between the traumatic event and the onset of the symptoms
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders individuals with posttrau- matic stress disorder may describe painful guilt feelings about surviving when others did not survive or about the things they had to do to survive phobic avoidance of situations or activities that resemble or symbolize the original trauma may interfere with interpersonal relationships and lead to marital conflict divorce or loss of job the following associated constellation of symptoms may occur and are more commonly seen in association with an interpersonal stressorchildhood sexual or physical abuse domestic battering being taken hostage incarceration as a prisoner of war or in a concentration camp torture impaired affect modulation self-destructive and impulsive behavior dissociative symptoms somatic complaints feelings of ineffectiveness shame despair or hopelessness feeling permanently damaged a loss of previously sustained beliefs hostility social withdrawal feeling constantly threatened impaired relationships with others or a change from the individual's previous personality characteristics
there may be increased risk of panic disorder agoraphobia obsessive-compulsive disorder social phobia specific phobia major depressive disorder somatization disorder and substance-related disorders it is not known to what extent these disorders precede or follow the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder

associated laboratory findings increased arousal may be measured through stud-
ies of autonomic functioningheart rate electromyography sweat gland activity
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
general medical conditions may occur as a consequence of the traumahead injury burns
specific culture and age features
individuals who have recently emigrated from areas of considerable social unrest and civil conflict may have elevated rates of posttraumatic stress disorder such individuals may be especially reluctant to divulge experiences of torture and trauma due to their vulnerable political immigrant status specific assessments of traumatic experiences and concomitant symptoms are needed for such individuals
in younger children distressing dreams of the event may within several weeks change into generalized nightmares of monsters of rescuing others or of threats to self or others y oung children usually do not have the sense that they are reliving the past rather the reliving of the trauma may occur through repetitive playa child who was involved in a serious automobile accident repeatedly reenacts car crashes with toy cars because it may be difficult for children to report diminished interest in significant activities and constriction of affect these symptoms should be carefully evaluated with reports from parents teachers and other observers in children the sense of a foreshortened future may be evidenced by the belief that life will be too short to include becoming an adult there may also be omen formationâ€”that is belief in an ability to foresee future untoward events children may also exhibit various physical symptoms such as stomachaches and headaches
prevalence
community-based studies reveal a lifetime prevalence for posttraumaticstress disorder ranging from 1% to 14% with the variability related to methods of ascertainment and the population sampled studies of at-risk individualscombat veterans victims of volcanic eruptions or criminal violence have yielded prevalence rates ranging from 3% to 58%
course
posttraumatic stress disorder can occur at any age including childhood symptoms usually begin within the first 3 months after the trauma although there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms appear frequently the disturbance initially meets criteria for acute stress disorder see p 429 in the immediate aftermath of the trauma the symptoms of the disorder and the relative predominance of reexperiencing avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms may vary over time duration of the symptoms varies with complete recovery occurring within 3 months in approximately half of cases with many others having persisting symptoms for longer than 12 months after the trauma
the severity duration and proximity of an individual's exposure to the traumatic event are the most important factors affecting the likelihood of developing this disorder there is some evidence that social supports family history childhood experiences
30981 posttraumatic stress disorder 427
personality variables and preexisting mental disorders may influence the development of posttraumatic stress disorder this disorder can develop in individuals without any predisposing conditions particularly if the stressor is especially extreme
differential diagnosis
in posttraumatic stress disorder the stressor must be of an extreme ie life-threatening nature in contrast in adjustment disorder the stressor can be of any severity the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is appropriate both for situations in which the response to an extreme stressor does not meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder or another specific mental disorder and for situations in which the symptom pattern of posttraumatic stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that is not extremespouse leaving being fired
not all psychopathology that occurs in individuals exposed to an extreme stressor should necessarily be attributed to posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms of avoid- ance numbing and increased arousal that are present before exposure to the stressor do not meet criteria for the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and require consideration of other diagnosesa mood disorder or another anxiety disorder moreover if the symptom response pattern to the extreme stressor meets criteria for another mental disorderbrief psychotic disorder conversion disorder major depressive disorder these diagnoses should be given instead of or in addition to posttraumaticstress disorder
acute stress disorder is distinguished from posttraumaticstress disorder because the symptom pattern in acute stress disorder must occur within 4 weeks of the traumatic event and resolve within that 4-week period if the symptoms persist for more than 1 month and meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder the diagnosis is changed from acute stress disorder to posttraumatic stress disorder
in obsessive-compulsive disorder there are recurrent intrusive thoughts but these are experienced as inappropriate and are not related to an experienced traumatic event flashbacks in posttraumatic stress disorder must be distinguished from illusions hallucinations and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia other psychotic disorders mood disorder with psychotic features a delirium substance-induced disorders andpsychotic disorders due to a general medical condition
malingering should be ruled out in those situations in which financial remunera- tion benefit eligibility and forensic determinations play a role

the essential feature of acute stress disorder is the development of characteristic anxiety dissociative and other symptoms that occurs within 1 month after exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor criterion a for a discussion of the types of stressors involved see the description of posttraumatic stress disorder p 424 either while experiencing the traumatic event or after the event the individual has at least three of the following dissociative symptoms a subjective sense of numbing detachment or absence of emotional responsiveness a reduction in awareness of his or her surround- ings derealization depersonalization or dissociative amnesia criterion b following the trauma the traumatic event is persistently reexperienced criterion c and the individual displays marked avoidance of stimuli that may arouse recollections of the trauma criterion d and has marked symptoms of anxiety or increased arousal criterion e the symptoms must cause clinically significant distress significantly interfere with normal functioning or impair the individual's ability to pursue necessary tasks criterion f the disturbance lasts for at least 2 days and does not persist beyond 4 weeks after the traumatic event criterion g the symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance ie a drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition are not better accounted for by brief psychotic disorder and are not merely an exacerbation of a preexisting mental disorder criterion h

associated features and disorders
a ssociated descriptive features and m ental disorders symptoms of despair and hopelessness may be experienced in acute stress disorder and may be sufficiently severe and persistent to meet criteria for a major depressive episode in which case an additional diagnosis of major depressive disorder may be warranted if the trauma led to another's death or to serious injury survivors may feel guilt about having remained intact or about not providing enough help to others individuals with this disorder often perceive themselves to have greater responsibility for the consequences of the trauma than is warranted problems may result from the individual's neglect of basic health and safety needs associated with the aftermath of the trauma individuals with this disorder are at increased risk for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder impulsive and risk-taking behavior may occur after the trauma
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
general medical conditions may occur as a consequence of the traumahead injury burns
specific culture features
although some events are likely to be universally experienced as traumatic the severity and pattern of response may be modulated by cultural differences in the implications of loss there may also be culturally prescribed coping behaviors that are characteristic of particular cultures for example dissociative symptoms may be a more prominent part of the acute stress response in cultures in which such behaviors are sanctioned for further discussion of culturalfactors related to traumatic events see p 426
prevalence
the prevalence of acute stress disorder in a population exposed to a serious traumatic stress depends on the severity and persistence of the trauma and the degree of exposure to it
course
symptoms of acute stress disorder are experienced during or immediately after the trauma last for at least 2 days and either resolve within 4 weeks after the conclusion of the traumatic event or the diagnosis is changed when symptoms persist beyond 1 month a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder may be appropriate if the full criteria for posttraumaticstress disorder are met the severity duration and proximit of an individual's exposure to the traumatic event are the most important factors in determining the likelihood of development of acute stress disorder there is some
evidence that social supports family history childhood experiences personality vari- ables and preexisting mental disorders may influence the development of acutestress disorder this disorder can develop in individualswithout any predisposing conditions particularly if the stressor is especially extreme
differential diagnosis
some symptomatology following exposure to an extreme stress is ubiquitous and often does not require any diagnosis acute stress disorder should only be considered if the symptoms last at least 2 days and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning or impair the individual's ability to pursue some necessary taskobtaining necessary assistance or mobilizing personal resources by telling family members about the traumatic experience
acute stress disorder must be distinguished from a mental disorder due to a general medical conditionhead trauma see p 165 and from a substance- induced disorderrelated to alcohol intoxication see p 192 which may be common consequences of exposure to an extreme stressor in some individuals psychotic symptoms may occur following an extreme stressor in such cases brief psychotic disorder is diagnosed instead of acute stress disorder if a major depres- sive episode develops after the trauma a diagnosis of major depressive disorder should be considered in addition to a diagnosis of acute stress disorder a separate diagnosis of acute stress disorder should not be made if the symptoms are an exacerbation of a preexisting mental disorder
by definition a diagnosis of acute stress disorder is appropriate only for symptoms that occur within 1 month of the extreme stressor because posttraumatic stress disorder requires more than 1 month of symptoms this diagnosis cannot be made during this initial 1-month period for individuals with the diagnosis of acute stress disorder whose symptoms persist for longer than 1 month the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder should be considered for individuals who have an extreme stressor but who develop a symptom pattern that does not meet criteria for acute stress disorder a diagnosis of adjustment disorder should be considered
malingering must be ruled out in those situationsin which financialremuneration benefit eligibility or forensic determinations play a role

difficult to control the worry criterion b the anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three additional symptoms from a list that includes restlessness being easily fatigued difficulty concentrating irritability muscle tension and disturbed sleep only one additional symptom is required in children criterion c the focus of the anxiety and worry is not confined to features of another axis i disorder such as having a panic attack as in panic disorder being embarrassed in public as in social phobia being contaminated as in obsessive-compulsive disorder being away from home or close relatives as in separation anxiety disorder gaining weight as in anorexia nervosa having multiple physical complaints as in somatization disorder or having a serious illness as in hypochondriasis and the anxiety and worry do not occur exclusively during posttraumatic stress disorder criterion d although individuals with general- ized anxiety disorder may not always identify the worries as excessive they report subjective distress due to constant worry have difficulty controlling the worry or experience related impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion e the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance ie a drug of abuse a medication or toxin exposure or a general medical condition and does not occur exclusively during a mood disorder a psychotic disorder or a pervasive developmental disorder criterionf
the intensity duration or frequency of the anxiety and worry is far out of proportion to the actual likelihood or impact of the feared event the person finds it difficult to keep worrisome thoughts from interfering with attention to tasks at hand and has difficulty stopping the worry adults with generalized anxiety disorder often worry about everyday routine life circumstances such as possible job responsibilities finances the health of family members misfortune to their children or minor matters such as household chores car repairs or being late for appointments children with generalized anxiety disorder tend to worry excessively about their competence or the quality of their performance during the course of the disorder the focus of worry may shift from one concern to another
associated features and disorders

worries often concern the quality of their performance or competence at school or in sporting events even when their performance is not being evaluated by others there may be excessive concerns about punctuality they may also worry about catastrophic events such as earthquakes or nuclear war children with the disorder may be overly conforming perfectionist and unsure of themselves and tend to redo tasks because of excessive dissatisfaction with less-than-perfect performance they are typically over- zealous in seeking approval and require excessive reassurance about their performance and their other worries
in clinical settings the disorder is diagnosed somewhat more frequently in women than in men about 55%-60% of those presenting with the disorder are female in epidemiological studies the sex ratio is approximately two-thirds female
prevalence
in a community sample the 1-year prevalence rate for generalized anxiety disorder was approximately 3% and the lifetime prevalence rate was 5% in anxiety disorder clinics approximately 12% of the individuals present with generalized anxiety disorder
course
many individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report that they have felt anxious and nervous all their lives although over half of those presenting for treatment report onset in childhood or adolescence onset occurring after age 20 years is not uncommon the course is chronic but fluctuating and often worsens during times of stress
familial pattern
anxiety as a trait has a familial association inconsistent findings have been reported regarding familial patterns for generalized anxiety disorder with most reports failing to find specific familial aggregation
differential diagnosis
generalized anxiety disorder must be distinguished from an anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition the diagnosis is anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition if the anxiety symptoms are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical conditionpheochromocytoma hyper- thyroidism see p 436 this determination is based on history laboratory findings or physical examination a substance-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder by the fact that a substance ie a drug of abuse a medication or exposure to a toxin is judged to be etiologically related to the anxiety disturbance see p 439 for example severe anxiety that occurs only in the context of heavy coffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced anxietydisorder with generalizedanxiety
when another axis i disorder is present an additional diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder should be made only when the focus of the anxiety and worry is unrelated to the other disorder that is the excessive worry is not restricted to having a

panic attack as in panic disorder being embarrassed in public as in social phobia being contaminated as in obsessive-compulsive disorder gaining weight as in anorexia nervosa having a serious illness as inhypochondriasis havingmultiple physical complaints as in somatization disorder or to concerns about the welfare of close relations or being away from them or from home as in separation anxiety disorder for example the anxiety present in social phobia is focused on upcoming social situations in which the individual must perform or be evaluated by others whereas individuals with generalized anxiety disorder experience anxiety whether or not they are being evaluated
several features distinguish the excessive worry of generalized anxiety disorder from the obsessional thoughts of obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessional thoughts are not simply excessive worries about everyday or real-life problems but rather are ego-dystonic intrusions that often take the form of urges impulses and images in addition to thoughts finally most obsessions are accompanied by compulsions that reduce the anxiety associated with the obsessions
anxiety is invariably present in posttraumatic stress disorder generalized anxiety disorder is not diagnosed if the anxiety occurs exclusively during the course of posttraumatic stress disorder anxiety may also be present in adjustment disorder but this residual category should be used only when the criteria are not met for any other anxiety disorder including generalized anxiety disorder moreover in adjust- ment disorder the anxiety occurs in response to a life stressor and does not persist for more than 6 months after the termination of the stressor or its consequences generalized anxiety is a common associated feature of mood disorders and psychotic disorders and should not be diagnosed separately if it occurs exclusively during the course of these conditions
several features distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from nonpathological anxiety first the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are difficult to control and typically interfere significantly with functioning whereas the worries of everyday life are perceived as more controllable and can be put off until later second the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are more pervasive pro- nounced distressing and of longer duration and frequently occur without precipitants the more life circumstances about which a person worries excessively finances children's safety job performance car repairs the more likely the diagnosis third everyday worries are much less likely to be accompanied by physical symptomsexcessive fatigue restlessness feeling keyed up or on edge irritability although this is less true of children

in determining whether the anxiety symptoms are due to a general medical condition the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical condition further the clinician must establish that the anxiety symptoms are etiologically related to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism a careful and comprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the anxiety symptoms and the general medical condition is etiological several considerations provide some guidance in this area one consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset exacerbation or remission of the general medical condition and the anxiety symptoms a second consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorderatypical age at onset or course or absence of family history evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a direct association between the general medical condition in question and the development of anxiety symptoms may provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation in addition the clinician must also judge that the disturbance is not better accounted for by a primary anxiety disorder a substance-induced anxiety disorder or other primary mental disordersadjustment disorder these determi- nations are explained in greater detail in the mental disorders due to a general medical condition section p 165

a variety of general medical conditions may cause anxiety symptoms including endocrine conditionshyper- and hypothyroidism pheochromocytoma hypo- glycemia hyperadrenocorticism cardiovascular conditionscongestive heart fail- ure pulmonary embolism arrhythmia respiratory- conditionschronic obstructive pulmonary disease pneumonia hyperventilation metabolic conditionsvitamin b12 deficiency porphyria and neurological conditionsneoplasms vestibular dysfunction encephalitis the associated physical examination findings laboratory findings and patterns of prevalence or onset reflect the etiological general medical condition
differential diagnosis
a separate diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition is not given if the anxiety disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium if the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptomsmood and anxiety the specific mental disorder due to a general medical condition depends on which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture
if there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use including medications with psychoactive effects withdrawal from a substance or exposure to a toxin a substance-induced anxiety disorder should be considered it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation symptoms that occur during or shortly after ie within 4 weeks of substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance-induced anxiety disorder depending on the type duration or amount of the substance used if the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a general medical condition and substance use both diagnoses ie anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition and substance-induced anxiety disorder can be given
anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition should be distinguished from a primary anxiety disorder especially panic disorder generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder and from adjustment disorder with anxiety or with mixed anxiety and depressed mooda maladaptive response to the stress of having a general medical condition in primary mental disorders no specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with a general medical condition can be demonstrated late age at onset and the absence of a personal or family history of anxiety disorders suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition in addition anxiety symptoms may be an associated feature of another mental disorderschizo- phrenia anorexia nervosa

a substance-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from a primary anxiety disorder by considering the onset course and other factors for drugs of abuse there must be evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory findings of intoxication or withdrawal substance-induced anxiety disorders arise only in associa- tion with intoxication or withdrawal states whereas primary anxiety disorders may precede the onset of substance use or occur during times of sustained abstinence because the withdrawal state for some substancessome benzodiazepines can be relatively protracted the onset of the anxiety symptoms can occur up to 4 weeks after cessation of substance use another consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorderatypical age at onset or course for example the onset of panic disorder after age 45 years which is rare or the presence ofatypical symptoms during a panic attacktrue vertigo loss of balance consciousness or bladder or bowel control headaches slurred speech or amnesia may suggest a substance-induced etiology in contrast factors suggesting that the anxiety symptoms are better accounted for by a primary anxiety disorder include persistence of anxiety symptoms for a substantial period of time ie about a month after the end of substance intoxication or acute withdrawal the development of symptoms that are substantially in excess of what would be expected given the type or amount of the substance used or the duration of use or a history of prior recurrent primary anxiety disorders
specifiers
the following specifiers can be used to indicate which symptom presentation pre- dominates
with generalized anxiety this specifier may be used if excessive anxiety or worry about a number of events or activities predominates in the clinical presentation
with panic attacks this specifier may be used if panic attacks see p 394 predominate in the clinical presentation
with obsessive-compulsive symptoms this specifier may be used if obses- sions or compulsions predominate in the clinical presentation
with phobic symptoms this specifier may be used if phobic symptoms predominate in the clinical presentation
the context of the development of the anxiety symptoms may be indicated by using one of the following specifiers
with onset during intoxication this specifier should be used if criteria for intoxication with the substance are met and the symptoms develop during the intoxication syndrome
substance-induced anxiety disorder 441
with onset during withdrawal this specifier should be used if criteria for withdrawal from the substance are met and the symptoms develop during or shortly after a withdrawal syndrome
recording procedures
the name of the diagnosis of substance-induced anxiety disorder begins with the specific substancealcohol methylphenidate thyroxine that is presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms the diagnostic code is selected from the listing of classes of substances provided in the criteria set for substances that do not fit into any of the classesthyroxine the code for other substance should be used in addition for medications prescribed at therapeutic doses the specific medication can be indicated by listing the appropriate e-code on axis i see appendix g the name of the disordercaffeine-induced anxiety disorder is followed by the specification of the predominant symptom presentation and the context in which the symptoms developed29289 caffeine-induced anxiety disorder with panic attacks with onset during intoxication when more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symptoms each should be listed separately29289 cocaine-induced anxiety disorder with generalized anxiety with onset during intoxication 2918 alcohol-induced anxiety disorder with generalized anxietywith onset during withdrawal if a substance is judged to be the etiological factor but the specific substance or class of substances is unknown the category 29289 unknown substance-induced anxiety disorder should be used
specific substances
anxiety disorders can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances alcohol amphetamine and related substances caffeine cannabis cocaine hallucinogens inhalants phencyclidine and related substances and other or unknown substances anxiety disorders can occur in association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances alcohol cocaine sedatives hypnotics and anxiolytics and other or unknown substances
some of the medications reported to evoke anxiety symptoms include anesthetics and analgesics sympathomimetics or other bronchodilators anticholinergics insulin thyroid preparations oral contraceptives antihistamines antiparkinsonian medications corticosteroids antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications anticonvulsants lith- ium carbonate antipsychotic medications and antidepressant medications heavy metals and toxinsvolatile substances such as gasoline and paint organophosphate insecticides nerve gases carbon monoxide carbon dioxide may also cause anxiety symptoms
differential diagnosis
anxiety symptoms commonly occur in substance intoxication and substance with- drawal the diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation a diagnosis of substance-induced anxiety disorder should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the anxiety symptoms are judged to
442 anxiety disorders
be in excess of those usually associated with the intoxication or withdrawal syndrome and when the anxiety symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention for example anxiety symptoms are a characteristic feature of alcohol withdrawal alcohol-induced anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of alcohol withdrawal only if the anxiety symptoms are more severe than those usually encountered with alcohol withdrawal and are sufficiently severe to be a separate focus of attention and treatment if substance-induced anxiety symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium the anxiety symptoms are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately in substance-induced presentations that contain a mix of different types of symptomsmood psychotic and anxiety the specific type of substance-induced disorder to be diagnosed depends on which type of symptoms predominates in the clinical presentation
a substance-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from a prim ary a nxiety disorderbythefactthatasubstanceisjudgedtobeetiologicallyrelatedtothe symptoms see p 440
a substance-induced anxiety disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or general medical condition must have its onset while the person is receiving the medication or during withdrawal if a withdrawal syndrome is associated with the medication once the treatment is discontinued the anxiety symptoms will usually remit within days to several weeks depending on the half-life of the substance and the presence of a withdrawal syndrome if symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks other causes for the anxiety symptoms should be considered
because individuals with general medical conditions often take medications for those conditions the clinician must consider the possibility that the anxiety symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the general medical condition rather than the medication in which case anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition is diagnosed the history often provides the primary basis for such a judgment at times a change in the treatment for the general medical conditionmedication substitution or discontinuation may be needed to determine empirically for that person whether or not the medication is the causative agent if the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a general medical condition and substance use both diagnoses ie anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition and substance-induced anxietydisorder may be given when there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the anxiety symptoms are due to a substance including a medication or to a general medical condition or are primary ie not due to either a substance or a general medical condition anxiety disorder nototherwise specified would be indicated

somatoform disorders
the common feature of the somatoform disorders is the presence of physical symptoms that suggest a general medical condition hence the term somatoform and are not fully explained by a general medical condition by the direct effects of a substance or by another mental disorderpanic disorder the symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other areas of functioning in contrast to factitious disorders and malingering the physical symptoms are not intentional ie under voluntary control somatoform disorders differ from psychological factors affecting medical condition in that there is no diagnosable general medical condition to fully account for the physical symptoms the grouping of these disorders in a single section is based on clinical utility ie the need to exclude occult general medical conditions or substance-induced etiologies for the bodily symptoms rather than on assumptions regarding shared etiology or mechanism these disorders are often encountered in general medical settings
the following somatoform disorders are included in this section
somatization disorder historicallyreferred to as hysteria or briquet's syndrome is a polysymptomatic disorder that begins before age 30 years extends over a period of years and is characterized by a combination of pain gastrointestinal sexual and pseudoneurological symptoms
undifferentiated somatoform disorder is characterized by unexplainedphysical complaints lasting at least 6 months that are below the threshold for a diagnosis of somatization disorder
conversion disorder involves unexplained symptoms or deficits affecting volun- tary motor or sensory function that suggest a neurological or other general medical condition psychological factors are judged to be associated with the symptoms or deficits
pain disorder is characterized by pain as the predominant focus of clinical attention in addition psychological factors are judged to have an important role in its onset severity exacerbation or maintenance
hypochondriasis is the preoccupation with the fear of having or the idea that one hasa serious disease based on the person's misinterpretationof bodily symptoms or bodily functions
bodydysmorphic disorder isthe preoccupation with an imagined or exaggerated defect in physical appearance
somatoform disorder not otherwise specified is included for coding disorders with somatoform symptoms that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific somatoform disorders445
446 somatoform disorders

30081 somatization disorder

the essential feature of somatization disorder is a pattern of recurring multiple clinically significant somatic complaints a somatic complaint is considered to be clinically significant if it results in medical treatmentthe taking of medication or causes significant impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning the somatic complaints must begin before age 30 years and occur over a period of several years criterion a the multiple somatic complaints cannot be fully explained by any known general medical condition or the direct effects of a substance if they occur in the presence of a general medical condition the physical complaints or resulting social or occupational impairment are in excess of what would be expected from the history physical examination or laboratory tests criterion c there must be a history of pain related to at least four different siteshead abdomen back joints extremities chest rectum or functionsmenstruation sexual intercourse urination criterion bl there also must be a history of at least two gastrointestinal symptoms other than pain criterion b2 most individuals with the disorder describe the presence of nausea and abdominal bloating vomiting diarrhea and food intolerance are less common gastrointestinal complaints often lead to frequent x-ray examinations and can result in abdominal surgery that in retrospect was unnecessary there must be a history of at least one sexual or reproductive symptom other than pain criterion b3 in women this may consist of irregular menses menorrhagia or vomiting throughout pregnancy in men there may be symptoms such as erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction both women and men may be subject to sexual indifference finally there must also be a history of at least one symptom other than pain that suggests a neurological condition conversion symptoms such as impaired coordination or balance paralysis or localized weakness difficulty swallowing or lump in throat aphonia urinary retention hallucinations loss of touch or pain sensation double vision blindness deafness or seizures dissociative symptoms such as amnesia or loss of consciousness other than fainting criterion b4 the symptoms in each of the groups have been listed in the approximate order of their reported frequency finally the unexplained symptoms in somatization disorder are not intentionally feigned or produced as in factitious disorder or malingering criterion d
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders individuals with somati- zation disorder usually describe their complaints in colorful exaggerated terms but specific factual information is often lacking they are often inconsistent historians so that a checklist approach to diagnostic interviewing may be less effective than a thorough review of medical treatments and hospitalizations to document a pattern of frequent somatic complaints they often seek treatment from several physicians concurrently which may lead to complicated and sometimes hazardous combinations of treatments prominent anxiety symptoms and depressed mood are very common and may be the reason for being seen in mental health settings there may be impulsive and antisocial behavior suicide threats and attempts and marital discord the lives of these individuals particularly those with associated personality disorders are often as chaotic and complicated as their medical histories frequent use of medications may lead to side
30081 somatization disorder 447
effects and substance-related disorders these individuals commonly undergo numer- ous medical examinations diagnostic procedures surgeries and hospitalizations which expose the person to an increased risk of morbidity associated with these procedures major depressive disorder panic disorder and substance-related disorders are fre- quently associated with somatization disorder histrionic borderline and antisocial personality disorders are the most frequently associated personality disorders
associated laboratory findings laboratory test results are remarkable for the ab- sence of findings to support the subjective complaints
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
physical examination is remarkable for the absence of objective findings to fully explain the many subjective complaints of individuals with somatization disorder these individuals may be diagnosed with so-called functional disordersirritable bowel syndrome however because these syndromes are as yet without established objective signs or specific laboratory findings their symptoms may count toward a diagnosis of somatization disorder
specific culture and gender features
the type and frequency of somatic symptoms may differ across cultures for example burning hands and feet or the nondelusional experience of worms in the head or ants crawling under the skin represent pseudoneurological symptoms that are more common in africa and south asia than in north america symptoms related to male reproductive function may be more prevalent in cultures in which there is widespread concern about semen lossdhat syndrome in india accordingly the symptom reviews should be adjusted to the culture the symptoms listed in this manual are examples that have been found most diagnostic in the united states it should be noted that the order of frequency was derived from studies done in the united states
somatization disorder occurs only rarely in men in the united states but the higher reported frequency in greek and puerto rican men suggests that cultural factors may influence the sex ratio
prevalence
studies have reported widely variable lifetime prevalence rates of somatization disorder ranging from 02% to 2% among women and less than 02% in men differences in rates may depend on whether the interviewer is a physician on the method of assessment and on the demographic variables in the samples studied when nonphysician inter- viewers are used somatization disorder is much less frequently diagnosed
course
somatization disorder is a chronic but fluctuatingdisorder that rarely remits completely a year seldom passes without the individual seeking some medical attention prompted by unexplained somatic complaints diagnostic criteria are typically met before age 25 years but initial symptoms are often present by adolescence menstrual difficulties may be one of the earliest symptoms in women sexual symptoms are often associated with marital discord
448 somatoform disorders
familial pattern
somatization disorder is observed in 10%-20% of female first-degree biological relatives of women with somatization disorder the male relatives of women with this disorder show an increased risk of antisocial personality disorder and substance-related disorders adoption studies indicate that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the risk for antisocial personality disorder substance-related disorders and somatization disorder having a biological or adoptive parent with any of these disorders increases the risk of developing either antisocial personality disorder a substance-related disorder or somatization disorder
differential diagnosis
the symptom picture encountered in somatization disorder is frequently nonspecific and can overlap with a multitude of general medical conditions three features that suggest a diagnosis of somatization disorder rather than a general medical condition include 1 involvement of multiple organ systems 2 early onset and chronic course without development of physical signs or structural abnormalities and 3 absence of laboratory abnormalities that are characteristic of the suggested general medical condi- tion it is still necessary to rule out general medical conditions that are characterized by vague multiple and confusing somatic symptomshyperparathyroidism acute intermittent porphyria multiple sclerosis systemic lupus erythematosus moreover somatization disorder does not protect individuals from having other independent general medical conditions objective findings should be evaluated without undue reliance on subjective complaints the onset of multiple physical symptoms late in life is almost always due to a general medical condition
schizophrenia with multiple somatic delusions needs to be differentiated from the nondelusional somatic complaints of individuals with somatization disorder in rare instances individuals with somatization disorder also have schizophrenia in which case both diagnoses should be noted furthermore hallucinations can occur as pseudoneuro- logical symptoms and must be distinguished from the typical hallucinations seen in schizophrenia see p 275
it can be very difficult to distinguish between anxiety disorders and somatization disorder in panic disorder multiple somatic symptoms are also present but these occur primarily during panic attacks however panic disorder may coexist with somatization disorder when the somatic symptoms occur at times other than during panic attacks both diagnoses may be made individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may have a multitude of physical complaints associated with their generalized anxiety but the focus of the anxiety and worry is not limited to the physical complaints individuals with mood disorders particularly depressive disorders may present with somatic complaints most commonly headache gastrointestinal disturbances or unexplained pain individuals with somatization disorder have physical complaints recur- rently throughout most of their lives regardless of their current mood state whereas physical complaints in depressive disorders are limited to episodes of depressed mood individuals with somatization disorder also often present with depressive complaints if criteria are met for both somatization disorder and a mood disorder both may be diagnosed
by definition all individuals with somatization disorder have a history of pain symptoms sexual symptoms and conversion or dissociative symptoms therefore if these symptoms occur exclusively during the course of somatization disorder there
30081 somatization disorder 449
should not be an additional diagnosis of pain disorder associated with psycholog- ical factors a sexual dysfunction conversion disorder or a dissociative disorder hypochondriasis is not be diagnosed if preoccupation with fears of having a serious illness occurs exclusively during the course of somatization disorder
the criteria for somatization disorder in this manual are slightly more restrictive than the original criteria for briquet's syndrome somatoform presentations that do not meet criteria for somatization disorder should be classified as undifferentiated somatoform disorder if the duration of the syndrome is 6 months or longer or somatoform disorder not otherwise specified for presentations of shorter duration
infactitiousdisorderwithpredominantly physicalsignsandsymptomsand malingering somatic symptoms may be intentionally produced to assume the sick role or for gain respectively symptoms that are intentionally produced should not count toward a diagnosis of somatization disorder however the presence of some factitious or malingered symptoms mixed with other nonintentional symptoms is not uncommon in such mixed cases both somatization disorder and a factitious disorder ormalingering should be diagnosed

broad range of personal and social problems without necessarily indicating psycho- pathology the highest frequency of unexplained physical complaints occurs in young women of low socioeconomic status but such symptoms are not limited to any age gender or sociocultural group neurasthenia a syndrome described frequently in many parts of the world and characterized by fatigue and weakness is classified in dsm-iv as undifferentiated somatoform disorder if symptoms have persisted for longer than 6 months
course
the course of individual unexplained physical complaints is unpredictable the eventual diagnosis of a general medical condition or another mental disorder is frequent
differential diagnosis
also refer to the differential diagnosis section for somatization disorder see p448 undifferentiated somatoform disorder is differentiated from somatization disorder by the requirement in somatization disorder of a multiplicity of symptoms of several years' duration and an onset before age 30 years individuals with somatization disorder are typically inconsistent historians so that at one evaluation they may report many symptoms that fulfill criteria for somatization disorder whereas at another time they may report many fewer symptoms that fail to meet full criteria if the physical complaints have persisted for less than 6 months a diagnosis of somatoform disorder not otherwise specified should be made undifferentiated somatoform disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disorder other mental disorders that frequently include unexplained physical complaints are major depressive disorder anxiety disorders and adjustment disorder in contrast to undifferentiated somatoform disorder the physical symptoms of factitious disorders and malingering are intentionally produced or feigned in factitious disorder the motivation is to assume the sick role and to obtain medical evaluation and treatment whereas in malingering more external incentives are apparent such as financial compensation avoidance of duty evasion of criminal prosecution or obtaining drugs

30011 conversion disorder

the essential feature of conversion disorder is the presence of symptoms or deficits affecting voluntary motor or sensory function that suggest a neurological or other general medical condition criterion a psychological factors are judged to be associated with the symptom or deficit a judgment based on the observation that the initiation or exacerbation of the symptom or deficit is preceded by conflicts or other stressors criterion b the symptoms are not intentionally produced or feigned as in factitious disorder or malingering criterion c conversion disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms or deficits are fully explained by a neurological or other general medical condition by the direct effects of a substance or as a culturally sanctioned behavior or experience criterion d the problem must be clinically significant as evidenced by marked distress impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning or the fact that it warrants medical evaluation criterion e conversion disorder is not diagnosed if symptoms are limited to pain or sexual dysfunction occur exclusively during the course of somatization disorder or are better accounted for by another mental disorder criterion f
conversion symptoms are related to voluntary motor or sensory functioning and are thus referred to as pseudoneurological motor symptoms or deficits include impaired coordination or balance paralysis or localized weakness aphonia difficulty swallowing or a sensation of a lump in the throat and urinary retention sensory symptoms or deficits include loss of touch or pain sensation double vision blindness deafness and hallucinations symptoms may also include seizures or convulsions the more medically naive the person the more implausible are the presenting symptoms more sophisticated
persons tend to have more subtle symptoms and deficits that may closely simulate neurological or other general medical conditions
a diagnosis of conversion disorder should be made only after a thorough medical investigation has been performed to rule out an etiological neurological or general medical condition because a general medical etiology for many cases of apparent conversion disorder can take years to become evident the diagnosis should be viewed as tentative and provisional in early studies general medical etiologies were later found in from one-quarter to one-half of persons initially diagnosed with conversion symptoms in more recent studies misdiagnosis is less evident perhaps reflecting increased awareness of the disorder as well as improved knowledge and diagnostic techniques a history of other unexplained somatic especially conversion or dissociative symptoms signifies a greater likelihood that an apparent conversion symptom is not due to a general medical condition especially if criteria for somatization disorder have been met in the past
conversion symptoms typically do not conform to known anatomical pathways and physiological mechanisms but instead follow the individual's conceptualization of a condition a paralysis may involve inability to perform a particular movement or to move an entire body part rather than a deficit corresponding to patterns of motor innervation conversion symptoms are often inconsistent a paralyzed extremity will be moved inadvertently while dressing or when attention is directed elsewhere if placed above the head and released a paralyzed arm will briefly retain its position then fall to the side rather than striking the head unacknowledged strength in antagonistic muscles normal muscle tone and intact reflexes may be demonstrated an electro- myogram will be normal difficulty swallowing will be equal with liquids and solids conversion anesthesia of a foot or a hand may follow a so-called stocking-glove distribution with uniform no proximal to distal gradient loss of all sensory modalities ie touch temperature and pain sharply demarcated at an anatomical landmark rather than according to dermatomes a conversion seizure will vary from convulsion to convulsion and paroxysmal activity will not be evident on an eeg
even when following such guidelines carefully caution must be exercised knowl- edge of anatomical and physiological mechanisms is incomplete and available methods of objective assessment have limitations a broad range of neurological conditions may be misdiagnosed as conversion disorder prominent among them are multiple sclerosis myasthenia gravis and idiopathic or substance-induced dystonias however the pres- ence of a neurological condition does not preclude a diagnosis of conversion disorder as many as one-third of individuals with conversion symptoms have a current or prior neurological condition conversion disorder may be diagnosed in the presence of a neurological or other general medical condition if the symptoms are not fully explained given the nature and severity of the neurological or other general medical condition
traditionally the term conversion derived from the hypothesis that the individual's somatic symptom represents a symbolic resolution of an unconscious psychological conflict reducing anxiety and serving to keep the conflict out of awareness primary gain the individual might also derive secondary gain from the conversion symp- tomâ€”that is external benefits are obtained or noxious duties or responsibilities are evaded although the dsm-iv criteria set for conversion disorder does not necessarily imply that the symptoms involve such constructs it does require that psychological factors be associated with their onset or exacerbation because psychological factors are so ubiquitously present in relation to general medical conditions it can be difficult to establish whether a specific psychological factor is etiologically related to the symptom or deficit however a close temporal relationship between a conflict or stressor and the30011 conversion disorder 453
454 somatoform disorders
initiation or exacerbation of a symptom may be helpful in this determination especially if the person has developed conversion symptoms under similar circumstances in the past
although the individual may derive secondary gain from the conversion symptom unlike in malingeringor factitiousdisorder the symptoms are not intentionally produced to obtain the benefits the determination that a symptom is not intentionally produced or feigned can also be difficult generally it must be inferred from a careful evaluation of the context in which the symptom develops especially relative to potential external rewards or the assumption of the sick role supplementing the person's self-report with additional sources of informationfrom associates or records may be helpful
conversion disorder is not diagnosed if a symptom is fully explained as aculturally sanctioned behavior or experience for example visions or spells that occur as part of religious rituals in which such behaviors are encouraged and expected would not justify a diagnosis of conversion disorder unless the symptom exceeded what is contextually expected and caused undue distress or impairment in epidemic hysteria shared symptoms develop in a circumscribed group of people following exposure to a common precipitant a diagnosis of conversion disorder should be made only if the individual experiences clinically significant distress or impairment
subtypes
the following subtypes are noted based on the nature of the presenting symptom or deficit
with motor symptom or deficit this subtype includes such symptoms as impaired coordination or balance paralysis or localized weakness difficulty swallowing or lump in throat aphonia and urinary retention
with sensory symptom or deficit this subtype includes such symptoms as loss of touch or pain sensation double vision blindness deafness and halluci- nations
with seizures or convulsions this subtype includes seizures or convulsions with voluntary motor or sensory components
with mixed presentation this subtype is used if symptoms of more than one category are evident
associated features and disorders
associated descriptive features and mental disorders individuals with conver- sion symptoms may show la belle indifference ie a relative lack of concern about the nature or implications of the symptom or may also present in a dramatic or histrionic fashion because these individuals are often suggestible their symptoms may be modified or resolved based on external cues however it must be cautioned that this is not specific to conversion disorder and may also occur with general medical conditions symptoms may be more common following extreme psychosocial stresswarfare or the recent death of a significant figure dependency and the adoption of a sick role may be fostered in the course of treatment other nonconversion somatic complaints are common associated mental disorders include dissociative disorders major depres- sive disorder and histrionic antisocial and dependent personality disorders
associated laboratory findings no specific laboratory abnormalities are associated with conversion disorder in fact it is the absence of expected findings that suggests and supports the diagnosis of conversion disorder however laboratory findings consistent with a general medical condition do not exclude the diagnosis of conversion disorder because it only requires that a symptom not be fully explained by such a condition
associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions
symptoms of conversion disorder typically do not conform to known anatomical pathways and physiological mechanisms thus expected objective signsreflex changes are rarely present however a person may develop symptoms that resemble those observed in others or in themselvesindividuals with epilepsy may simulate seizures that resemble those they have observed in others or how their own seizures were described to them generally individual conversion symptoms are self-limited and do not lead to physical changes or disabilities rarely physical changes such as atrophy and contractures may occur as a result of disuse or as sequelae to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures it is important to note however that conversion symptoms can occur in individuals with neurological conditions
specific culture age and gender features
conversion disorder has been reported to be more common in rural populations individuals of lower socioeconomic status and individuals less knowledgeable about medical and psychological concepts higher rates of conversion symptoms are reported in developing regions with the incidence generally declining with increasing develop- ment falling down with loss or alteration of consciousness is a feature of a variety of culture-specific syndromes the form of conversion symptoms reflects local cultural ideas about acceptable and credible ways to express distress changes resembling conversion symptoms as well as dissociative symptoms are common aspects of certain culturally sanctioned religious and healing rituals the clinician must assess 'whether such symptoms are fully explained in the particular social context and whether they result in clinically significant distress disability or role impairment
conversion symptoms in children under age 10 years are usually limited to gait problems or seizures conversion disorder appears to be more frequent in women than in m e n  with reported ratios varying from 21 to 101 especially in women symptom are much more common on the left than on the right side of the body women rarely men presenting with conversion symptoms may later manifest the full picture of somatization disorder particularly in menan association with antisocialpersonality disorder is evident in men conversion disorder is often seen in the context ofindustrial accidents or the military in which cases it must be carefully differentiated from malingering
prevalence
reported rates of conversion disorder have varied widely ranging from 11/100000 to 300/100000 in general population samples it has been reported as a focus of treatment in l%-3% of outpatient referrals to mental health clinics

course
the onset of conversion disorder is generally from late childhood to early adulthood rarely before age 10 years or after age 35 years but onset as late as the ninth decade of life has been reported when an apparent conversion disorder first develops in middle or old agethe probability of an occult neurological or other general medical condition is high the onset of conversion disorder is generally acute but gradually increasing symptomatology may also occur typically individual conversion symptoms are of short duration in individuals hospitalized with conversion symptoms symptoms will remit within 2 weeks in most cases recurrence is common occurring in from one-fifth to one-quarter of individuals within 1 year with a single recurrence predicting future episodes factors that are associated with good prognosis include acute onset presence of clearly identifiable stress at the time of onset a short interval between onset and the institution of treatment and above average intelligence symptoms of paralysis aphonia and blindness are associated with a good prognosis whereas tremor and seizures arenot
familial pattern
limited data suggest that conversion symptoms are more frequent in relatives of individuals with conversion disorder increased risk of conversion disorder in mono- zygotic but not in dizygotic twin pairs has been reported
differential diagnosis
the major diagnostic concern in evaluating potential conversion symptoms is the exclusion of occult neurological or other general medical conditions and sub- stance including medication-induced etiologies appropriate evaluation of po- tential general medical conditionsmultiple sclerosis myasthenia gravis should include careful review of the current presentation the overall medical history neuro- logical and general physical examinations and appropriate laboratory studies including investigation for use of alcohol and other substances
pain disorder or a sexual dysfunction is diagnosed instead of conversion disorder if the symptoms are limited to pain or to sexual dysfunction respectively an additional diagnosis of conversion disorder should not be made if conversion symptoms occur exclusively during the course of somatization disorder conversion disorder is not diagnosed if symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disordercatatonic symptoms or somatic delusions in schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders or mood disorder or difficulty swallowing during a panic attack in hypochondriasis the individual is preoccupied with the serious disease underlying the pseudoneurological symptoms whereas in conversion disorder the focus is on the presenting symptom and there may be la belle indifference in body dysmorphic disorder the emphasis is on a preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in appearance rather than a change in voluntary motor or sensory function conversion disorder shares features with dissociative disorders both disorders involve symptoms that suggest neurological dysfunction and may also have shared antecedents if both conversion and dissociative symptoms occur in the same individual which is common both diagnoses should be made
itiscontroversialwhetherhallucinationspseudohallucinationscanbe considered as the presenting symptom of conversion disorder as distinguished from hallucina-
tions that occur in the context of a psychotic disorderschizophrenia or another psychotic disorder a psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition a substance-related disorder or a mood disorder with psychotic features hallucina- tions in conversion disorder generally occur with intact insight in the absence of other psychotic symptoms often involve more than one sensory modalitya hallucination involving visual auditory and tactile components and often have a naive fantastic or childish content they are often psychologically meaningful and tend to be described by the individual as an interesting story
symptoms of factitious disorders and malingering are intentionally produced or feigned in factitious disorder the motivation is to assume the sick role and to obtain medical evaluation and treatment whereas more obvious goals such as financial compensation avoidance of duty evasion of criminal prosecution or obtaining drugs are apparent in malingering such goals may resemble secondary gain in conversion symptoms with the distinguishing feature of conversion symptoms being the lack of conscious intent in the production of the symptom

3007 hypochondriasis

the essential feature of hypochondriasis is preoccupation with fears of having or the idea that one has a serious disease based on a misinterpretation of one or more bodily signs or symptoms criterion a a thorough medical evaluation does not identify a general medical condition that fully accounts for the person's concerns about disease or for the physical signs or symptoms although a coexisting general medical condition
may be present the unwarranted fear or idea of having a disease persists despite medical reassurance criterion b however the belief is not of delusional intensity ie the person can acknowledge the possibility that he or she may be exaggerating the extent of the feared disease or that there may be no disease at allthe belief is also not restricted to a circumscribed concern about appearance as seen in body dysmorphic disorder criterion c the preoccupation with bodily symptoms causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion d and lasts for at least 6 months criterion e the preoccupation is not better accounted for by generalized anxiety disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder panic disorder a major depressive episode separation anxiety or another somatoform disorder criterion f
the preoccupation in hypochondriasis may be with bodily functionsheartbeat sweating or peristalsis with minor physical abnormalitiesa small sore or an occasional cough or with vague and ambiguous physical sensationstired heart aching veins the person attributes these symptoms or signs to the suspected disease and is very concerned with their meaning authenticity and etiology the concerns may involve several body systems at different times or simultaneously alternatively there may be preoccupation with a specific organ or a single diseasefear of having cardiac disease repeated physical examinations diagnostic tests and reassurance from the physician do little to allay the concern about bodily disease or affliction for example an individual preoccupied with having cardiac disease will not be reassured by the repeated lack of findings on physical examination ecgor even cardiac angiography individuals with hypochondriasis may become alarmed by reading or hearing about disease knowing someone who becomes sick or from observations sensations or occurrences within their own bodies concern about the feared illness often becomes a central feature of the individual's self-image a topic of social discourse and a response to life stresses
specifier
with poor insight this specifier is used if for most of the time during the current episode the individual does not recognize that the concern about having a serious illness is excessive or unreasonable

3007 body dysmorphic disorder

the essential feature of body dysmorphic disorder historically known as dys- morphophobia is a preoccupation with a defect in appearance criterion a the defect is either imagined or if a slight physical anomaly is present the individual's concern is markedly excessive criterion a the preoccupation must cause significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion b the preoccupation is not better accounted for by another mental disorderdissatisfaction with body shape and size in anorexia nervosa criterionc
complaints commonly involve imagined or slight flaws of the face or head such as hair thinning acne wrinkles scars vascular markings paleness or redness of the complexion swelling facial asymmetry or disproportion or excessive facial hair other common preoccupations include the shape size or some other aspect of the nose eyes eyelids eyebrows ears mouth lips teeth jaw chin cheeks or head however any other body part may be the focus of concernthe genitals breasts buttocks abdomen arms hands feet legs hips shoulders spine larger body regions or overall body size the preoccupation may simultaneously focus on several body parts although the complaint is often specifica crooked lip or a bumpy nose it is sometimes vaguea falling face or inadequately firm eyes because of embarrassment over their concerns some individualswith body dysmorphic disorder avoid describing their defects in detail and may instead refer only to their general ugliness
most individuals with this disorder experience marked distress over their supposed deformity often describing their preoccupations as intensely painful tormenting or devastating most find their preoccupations difficult to control and they may make little or no attempt to resist them as a result they often spend hours a day thinking about their defect to the point where these thoughts may dominate their lives significant impairment in many areas of functioning generally occurs feelings of self-consciousness about their defect may lead to avoidance of work or public situations

30012 dissociative amnesia
formerly psychogenic amnesia 
the essential feature of dissociative amnesia is an inability to recall important personal information usually of a traumatic or stressful nature that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness criterion a this disorder involves a reversible memory impairment in which memories of personal experience cannot be retrieved in a verbal form or if temporarily retrieved cannot be wholly retained in consciousness the disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of dissociative identity disorder dissociative fugue posttraumatic stress disorder acute stress disorder or somatization disorder and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a neurological or other general medical condition criterion b the symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion c
dissociative amnesia most commonly presents as a retrospectively reported gap or series of gaps in recall for aspects of the individual's life history these gaps are usually related to traumatic or extremely stressful events some individuals may have amnesia for episodes of self-mutilation violent outbursts or suicide attempts less commonly dissociative amnesia presents as a florid episode with sudden onset this acute form is more likely to occur during wartime or in response to a natural disaster
several types of memory disturbances have been described in dissociative amnesia in localized amnesia the individual fails to recall events that occurred during a circumscribed period of time usually the first few hours following a profoundly disturbing eventthe uninjured survivor of a car accident in which a family member has been killed may not be able to recall anything that happened from the time of the accident until 2 days later in selective amnesia the person can recall some but not all of the events during a circumscribed period of timea combat veteran can recall only some parts of a series of violent combat experiences three other types of amnesiaâ€”generalized continuous and systematizedâ€”are less common in generalized amnesia failure of recall encompasses the person's entire life individuals with this rare disorder usually present to the police to emergency rooms or to general hospital consultation-liaison services continuous amnesia is defined as the inability to recall events subsequent to a specific time up to and including the present systematized amnesia is loss of memory for certain categories of information such as all memories relating to one's family or to a particular person individuals who exhibit these latter three types of dissociative amnesia may ultimately be diagnosed as having a more complex form of dissociative disorderdissociative identity disorder

30013 dissociative fugue formerly psychogenic fugue

the essential feature of dissociative fugue is sudden unexpected travel away from home or one's customary place of daily activities with inability to recall some or all of one's past criterion a this is accompanied by confusion about personal identity or even the assumption of a new identity criterion b the disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of dissociative identity disorder and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition criterion c the symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion d
travel may range from brief trips over relatively short periods of time ie hours or days to complex usually unobtrusive wandering over long time periodsweeks or months with some individuals reportedly crossing numerous national borders and traveling thousands of miles during a fugue individuals generally appear to be without psychopathology and do not attract attention at some point the individual is brought to clinical attention usually because of amnesia for recent events or a lack of awareness of personal identity once the individual returns to the prefugue state there may be no memory for the events that occurred during the fugue
most fugues do not involve the formation of a new identity if a new identity is assumed during a fugue it is usually characterized by more gregarious and uninhibited traits than characterized the former identity the person may assume a new name take up a new residence and engage in complex social activities that are well integrated and that do not suggest the presence of a mental disorder

30014 dissociative identity disorder
formerly multiple personality disorder 
the essential feature of dissociative identity disorder is the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states criterion a that recurrently take control of behavior criterion b there is an inability to recall important personal information the extent of which is too great to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness criterion c the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition criterion d in children the symptoms cannot be attributed to imaginary playmates or other fantasy play
dissociative identity disorder reflects a failure to integrate various aspects of identity memory and consciousness each personality state may be experienced as if it has a distinct personal history self-image and identity including a separate name usually there is a primary identity that carries the individual's given name and is passive dependent guilty and depressed the alternate identities frequently have different names and characteristics that contrast with the primary identityare hostile controlling and self-destructive particular identities may emerge in specific circum- stances and may differ in reported age and gender vocabulary general knowledge or predominant affect alternate identities are experienced as taking control in sequence one at the expense of the other and may deny knowledge of one another be critical of one another or appear to be in open conflict occasionally one or more powerful identities allocate time to the others aggressive or hostile identities may at times interrupt activities or place the others in uncomfortable situations
individuals with this disorder experience frequent gaps in memory for personal history both remote and recent the amnesia is frequently asymmetrical the more passive identities tend to have more constricted memories whereas the more hostile controlling or protector identities have more complete memories an identity that is not in control may nonetheless gain access to consciousness by producing auditory or visual hallucinationsa voice giving instructions evidence of amnesia may be uncovered by reports from others who have witnessed behavior that is disavowed by the individual or by the individual's own discoveriesfinding items of clothing at home that the individual cannot remember having bought there may be loss of memory not only for recurrent periods of time but also an overall loss of biographical memory for some extended period of childhood transitions among identities are often triggered by psychosocial stress the time required to switch from one identity to another is usually a matter of seconds but less frequently may be gradual the number of identities reported ranges from 2 to more than 100 half of reported cases include individuals with10 or fewer identities

3006 depersonalizetion disorder

the essential features of depersonalization disorder are persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization characterized by a feeling of detachment or estrangement from one's self criterion a the individual may feel like an automaton or as if he or she is living in a dream or a movie there may be a sensation of being an outside observer of one's mental processes one's body or parts of one's body various types of sensory anesthesia lack of affective response and a sensation of lacking control of one's actions including speech are often present the individual with depersonalization disorder maintains intact reality testingawareness that it is only a feeling and that he or she is not really an automaton criterion b depersonalization is a common experience and this diagnosis should be made only if the symptoms are sufficiently severe to cause marked distress or impairment in functioning criterion c because depersonalization is a common associated feature of many other mental disorders a separate diagnosis of depersonalization disorder is not made if the experience occurs exclusively during the course of another mental disorderschizophrenia panic disorder acute stress disorder or another dissociative disorder in addition the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition criterion d

30015 dissociative disorder not otherwise specified
this category is included for disorders in which the predominant feature is a dissociative symptom ie a disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness memory identity or perception of the environment that does not meet the criteria for any specific dissociative disorder examples include
1 clinical presentations similar to dissociative identity disorder that fail to meet full criteria for this disorder examples include presentations in which a there are not two or more distinct personality states or b amnesia for important personal information does not occur
2 derealization unaccompanied by depersonalization in adults

4 dissociative trance disorder single or episodic disturbances in the state of
consciousness identity or memory that are indigenous to particular locations and cultures dissociative trance involves narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or stereotyped behaviors or movements that are experienced as being beyond one's control possession trance involves replacement of the customary sense of personal identity by a new identity attributed to the influence of a spirit power deity or other person and associated with stereotyped involuntary movements or amnesia examples include amok indonesia bebainan indonesia latah malaysia pibloktoq arctic ataque de nervios latin america and possession india the dissociative or trance disorder is

30271 hypoactive sexual desire disorder

the essential feature of hypoactive sexual desire disorder is a deficiency or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity criterion a the disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty criterion b the dysfunction is not better accounted for by another axis i disorder except another sexual dysfunction and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance including medications or a general medical condition criterion c low sexual desire may be global and encompass all forms of sexual expression or may be situational and limited to one partner or to a specific sexual activityintercourse but not masturbation there is little motivation to seek stimuli and diminished frustration when deprived of the opportunity for sexual expression the individual usually does not initiate sexual activity or may only engage in it reluctantly when it is initiated by the partner although the frequency of sexual experiences is usually low pressure from the partner or nonsexual needsfor physical comfort or intimacy may increase the frequency of sexual encounters because of a lack of normative age- or gender-related data on frequency or degree of sexual desire the diagnosis must rely on clinicaljudgment based on the individual's characteristics the interpersonal determinants the life context and the cultural setting the clinician may need to assess both partners when discrepancies in sexual desire prompt the call for professional attention apparent low desire in one partner may instead reflect an excessive need for sexual expression by the other partner alternatively both partners may have levels of desire within the normal range but at different ends of the continuum
30279 sexual aversion disorder 499 30279 sexual aversion disorder

the essential feature of sexual aversion disorder is the aversion to and active avoidance of genital sexual contact with a sexual partner criterion a the disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty criterion b the dysfunction is not better accounted for by another axis i disorder except another sexual dysfunction criterion c the individual reports anxiety fear or disgust when confronted by a sexual opportunity with a partner the aversion to genital contact may be focused on a particular aspect of sexual experiencegenital secretions vaginal penetration some individuals experience generalized revulsion to all sexual stimuli including kissing and touching the intensity of the individual's reaction when exposed to the aversive stimulus may range from moderate anxiety and lack of pleasure to extreme psychological distress

30272 female sexual arousal disorder

the essential feature of female sexual arousal disorder is a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity an adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement criterion a the arousal response consists of vasocongestion in the pelvis vaginal lubrication and expansion and swelling of the external genitalia the disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty criterion b the dysfunction is not better accounted for by another axis i disorder except another sexual dysfunction and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance including medications or a general medical condition criterion c

30272 male erectile disorder

the essential feature of male erectile disorder is a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity an adequate erection criterion a the disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty criterion b the dysfunction is not better accounted for by another axis i disorder except another sexual dysfunction and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance including medications or a general medical condition crite- rion c
there are different patterns of erectile dysfunction some individuals will report the inability to obtain any erection from the outset of a sexual experience others will complain of first experiencing an adequate erection and then losing tumescence when attempting penetration still others will report that they have an erection that is sufficiently firm for penetration but that they then lose tumescence before or during thrusting some males may report being able to experience an erection only during self-masturbation or on awakening masturbatory erections may be lost as well but this is not common

30273 female orgasmic disorder formerly inhibited female orgasm

the essential feature of female orgasmic disorder is a persistent or recurrent delay in or absence of orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase criterion a women exhibit wide variability in the type or intensity of stimulation that triggers orgasm the diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder should be based on the clinician's judgment that the woman's orgasmic capacity is less than would be reasonable for her age sexual experience and the adequacy of sexual stimulation she receives the disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty criterion b the dysfunction is not better accounted for by another axis i disorder except another sexual dysfunction and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance including medications or a general medical condition criterionc

30274 male orgasmic disorder
formerly inhibited male orgasm

the essential feature of male orgasmic disorder is a persistent or recurrent delay in or absence of orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase in judging whether the orgasm is delayed the clinician should take into account the person's age and whether the stimulation is adequate in focus intensity and duration criterion a the disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty criterion b the orgasmic dysfunction is not better accounted for by another axis i disorder except another sexual dysfunction and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance including medications or a general medical condition criterion c in the most common form of male orgasmic disorder a male cannot reach orgasm during intercourse although he can ejaculate from a partner's manual or oral stimulation some males with male orgasmic disorder can reach coital orgasm but only after very prolonged and intense noncoital stimulation some can ejaculate only from masturbation an even smaller subgroup have experienced orgasm only at the moment of waking from an erotic dream

30275 premature ejaculation

the essential feature of premature ejaculation is the persistent or recurrent onset of orgasm and ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before on or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it criterion a the clinician must take into account factors that affect duration of the excitement phase such as age novelty of the sexual partner or situation and recent frequency of sexual activity the majority of males with this disorder can delay orgasm during self-masturbation for a considerably longer time than during coitus partners' estimates of the duration of time from the beginning of sexual activity until ejaculation as well as their judgment of whether premature ejaculation is a problem can be quite disparate the disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty criterion b the premature ejaculation is not due exclusively to the direct effects of a substancewithdrawal from opioids criterion c

30276 dyspareunia
not due to a general medical condition

the essential feature of dyspareunia is genital pain that is associated with sexual intercourse criterion a although it is most commonly experienced during coitus it may also occur before or after intercourse the disorder can occur in both males and females in females the pain may be described as superficial during intromission or as deep during penile thrusting the intensity of the symptoms may range from mild discomfort to sharp pain the disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty criterion b the disturbance is not caused exclusively by vaginismus or lack of lubrication is not better accounted for by another axis i disorder except for another sexual dysfunction and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substancea drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition criterionc

30651 vaginismus
not due to a general medical condition

the essential feature of vaginismus is the recurrent or persistent involuntary contraction of the perineal muscles surrounding the outer third of the vagina when vaginal penetration with penis finger tampon or speculum is attempted criterion a the disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty criterion b the disturbance is not better accounted for by another axis i disorder except another sexual dysfunction and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition criterion c in some females even the anticipation of vaginal insertion may result in muscle spasm the contraction may range from mild inducing some tightness and discomfort to severe preventing penetration

the essential feature of sexual dysfunction due to a general medical condition is the presence of clinically significant sexual dysfunction that is judged to be due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition the sexual dysfunction can involve pain associated with intercourse hypoactive sexual desire male erectile dysfunction or other forms of sexual dysfunctionorgasmic disorders and must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty criterion a there must be evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory findings that the dysfunction is fully explained by the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition criterion b the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disordermajor depressive disorder criterionc
in determining whether the sexual dysfunction is exclusively due to a general medical condition the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical condition furtherthe clinician must establish that the sexual dysfunction isetiologically related to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism a careful and comprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the sexual dysfunction and the general medical condition is etiological several considerations provide some guidance in this area one consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset exacerbation or remission of the general
516 sexual and gender identity disorders
medical condition and that of the sexual dysfunction a second consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of a primary sexual dysfunctionatypical age at onset or course evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a direct association between the general medical condition in question and the development of the sexual dysfunction can provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation in addition the clinician must also judge that the disturbance is not better accounted for by a primary sexual dysfunction a substance-induced sexual dysfunction or another primary mental disordermajor depressive disorder these determinations are explained in greater detail in the mental disorders due to a general medical condition section p 165
in contrast a sexual dysfunction diagnosis with the subtype due to combined factors is made if a combination of psychological factors and either a general medical condition or a substance is judged to have an etiological role but no one etiology is sufficient to account for the dysfunction

30270 sexual dysfunction not otherwise specified
this category includes sexual dysfunctions that do not meet criteria for any specific sexual dysfunction examples include
1 no or substantially diminished subjective erotic feelings despite otherwise- normal arousal and orgasm
2 situations in which the clinician has concluded that a sexual dysfunction is present but is unable to determine whether it is primary due to a general medical condition or substance induced
paraphiliasthe essential features of a paraphilia are recurrent intense sexually arousing fantasies sexual urges or behaviors generally involving 1 nonhuman objects 2 the suffering or
humiliation of oneself or one's partner or 3 children or other nonconsenting persons that occur over a period of at least 6 months criterion a for some individuals paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli are obligatory for erotic arousal and are always included in sexual activity in other cases the paraphiliac preferences occur only episodicallyperhaps during periods of stress whereas at other times the person is able to function sexually without paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli the behavior sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion b
paraphiliac imagery may be acted out with a nonconsenting partner in a way that may be injurious to the partner as in sexual sadism or pedophilia the individual may be subject to arrest and incarceration sexual offenses against children constitute a significant proportion of all reported criminal sex acts and individuals with exhibition- ism pedophilia and voyeurism make up the majority of apprehended sex offenders in some situations acting out the paraphiliac imagery may lead to self-injury as in sexual masochism social and sexual relationships may suffer if others find the unusual sexual behavior shameful or repugnant or if the individual's sexual partner refuses to cooperate in the unusual sexual preferences in some instances the unusual behaviorexhibitionistic acts or the collection of fetish objects may become the major sexual activity in the individual's life these individuals are rarely self-referred and usually come to the attention of mental health professionals only when their behavior has brought them into conflict with sexual partners or society
the paraphilias described here are conditions that have been specifically identified by previous classifications they include exhibitionism exposure of genitals fetishism use of nonliving objects frotteurism touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person pedophilia focus on prepubescent children sexual masochism receiving humiliation or suffering sexual sadism inflicting humiliation or suffering transvestic fetishism cross-dressing and voyeurism observing sexual activity a residual cate- gory paraphilia not otherwise specified includes other paraphilias that are less frequently encountered not uncommonly individuals have more than one paraphilia

gender identity disorders gender identity disorder

there are two components of gender identity disorder both of which must be present to make the diagnosis there must be evidence of a strong and persistent cross-gender identification which is the desire to be or the insistence that one is of the other sex
criterion a this cross-gender identification must not merely be a desire for any perceived cultural advantages of being the other sex there must also be evidence of persistent discomfort about one's assigned sex or a sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex criterion b the diagnosis is not made if the individual has a concurrent physical intersex conditionandrogen insensitivity syndrome or con- genital adrenal hyperplasia criterion c to make the diagnosis there must be evidence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion d
in boys the cross-gender identification is manifested by a marked preoccupation with traditionally feminine activities they may have a preference for dressing in girls' or women's clothes or may improvise such items from available materials when genuine articles are unavailable towels aprons and scarves are often used to represent long hair or skirts there is a strong attraction for the stereotypical games and pastimes of girls they particularly enjoy playing house drawing pictures of beautiful girls and princesses and watching television or videos of their favorite female characters stereotypical female-type dolls such as barbie are often their favorite toys and girls are their preferred playmates when playing house these boys role-play female figures most commonly mother roles and often are quite preoccupied with female fantasy figures they avoid rough-and-tumble play and competitive sports and have little interest in cars and trucks or other nonaggressive but stereotypical boy's toys they may express a wish to be a girl and assert that they will grow up to be a woman they may insist on sitting to urinate and pretend not to have a penis by pushing it in between their legs more rarely boys with gender identity disorder may state that they find their penis or testes disgusting that they want to remove them or that they have or wish to have a vagina
girls with gender identity disorder display intense negative reactions to parental expectations or attempts to have them wear dresses or other feminine attire some may refuse to attend school or social events where such clothes may be required they prefer boy's clothing and short hair are often misidentified by strangers as boys and may ask to be called by a boy's name their fantasy heroes are most often powerful male figures such as batman or superman these girls prefer boys as playmates with whom they share interests in contact sports rough-and-tumble play and traditional boyhood games they show little interest in dolls or any form of feminine dress up or role-play activity a girl with this disorder may occasionally refuse to urinate in a sitting position she may claim that she has or will grow a penis and may not want to grow breasts or to menstruate she may assert that she will grow up to be a man such girls typically reveal marked cross-gender identification in role-play dreams and fantasies
adults with gender identity disorder are preoccupied with their wish to live as a member of the other sex this preoccupation may be manifested as an intense desire to adopt the social role of the other sex or to acquire the physical appearance of the other sex through hormonal or surgical manipulation adults with this disorder are uncomfortable being regarded by others as or functioning in society as a member of their designated sex to varying degrees they adopt the behavior dress and mannerisms of the other sex in private these individuals may spend much time cross-dressed and working on the appearance of being the other sex many attempt to pass in public as the other sex with cross-dressing and hormonal treatment and for males electrolysis many individuals with this disorder may pass convincingly as the other sex the sexual activity of these individuals with same-sex partners is generally constrained by the preference that their partners neither see nor touch their genitals for some males who present later in life often following marriage sexual activity with a woman is accompanied by the fantasy of being lesbian lovers or that his partner is a man and he is a woman
in adolescents the clinical features may resemble either those of children or those of adults depending on the individual's developmental level and the criteria should be applied accordingly in a younger adolescent it may be more difficult to arrive at an accurate diagnosis because of the adolescent's guardedness this may be increased if the adolescent feels ambivalent about cross-gender identification or feels that it is unacceptable to the family the adolescent may be referred because the parents or teachers are concerned about social isolation or peer teasing and rejection in such circumstances the diagnosis should be reserved for those adolescents who appear quite cross-gender identified in their dress and who engage in behaviors that suggest significant cross-gender identificationshaving legs in males clarifying the diagnosis in children and adolescents may require monitoring over an extended period of time
distress or disability in individuals with gender identity disorder is manifested differently across the life cycle in young children distress is manifested by the stated unhappiness about their assigned sex preoccupation with cross-gender wishes often interferes with ordinary activities in older children failure to develop age-appropriate same-sex peer relationships and skills often leads to isolation and distress and some children may refuse to attend school because of teasing or pressure to dress in attire stereotypical of their assigned sex in adolescents and adults preoccupation with cross-gender wishes often interferes with ordinary activities relationship difficulties are common and functioning at school or at work may be impaired

3071 anorexia nervosa

the essential features of anorexia nervosa are that the individual refuses to maintain a minimally normal body weight is intensely afraid of gaining weight and exhibits a significant disturbance in the perception of the shape or size of his or her body in addition postmenarcheal females with this disorder are amenorrheic the term anorexia is a misnomer because loss of appetite is rare
the individual maintains a body weight that is below a minimally normal level for age and height criterion a when anorexia nervosa develops in an individual during childhood or early adolescence there may be failure to make expected weight gains ie while growing in height instead of weight loss criterion a provides a guideline for determining when the individual meets the threshold for being underweight it suggests that the individual weigh less than 85%of that weight that is considered normal for that person's age and height usually computed using one of several published versions of the metropolitan life insurance tables or pediatric growth charts an alternative and somewhat stricter guideline used in the icd-10 diagnostic criteria for research requires that the individual have a body mass index bmi calculated as weight in kilograms/height in meters2 equal to or below 175 kg/m2 these cutoffs are provided only as suggested guidelines for the clinician since it is unreasonable to specify a single standard for minimally normal weight that applies to all individuals of a given age and height in determining a minimally normal weight the clinician should consider not only such guidelines but also the individual's body build and weight history
usually weight loss is accomplished primarily through reduction in total food intake although individuals may begin by excluding from their diet what they perceive to be highly caloric foods most eventually end up with a very restricted diet that is sometimes limited to only a few foods additional methods of weight loss include purging ie self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives or diuretics and increased or excessive exercise
individuals with this disorder intensely fear gaining weight or becoming fat criterion b this intense fear of becoming fat is usually not alleviated by the weight loss in fact concern about weight gain often increases even as actual weight continues to decrease
the experience and significance of body weight and shape are distorted in these individuals criterion c some individuals feel globally overweight others realize that they are thin but are still concerned that certain parts of their bodies particularly the abdomen buttocks and thighs are too fat they may employ a wide variety of techniques to estimate their body size or weight including excessive weighing obsessive measuring of body parts and persistently using a mirror to check for perceived areas of fat the self-esteem of individuals with anorexia nervosa is highly dependent on their body shape and weight weight loss is viewed as an impressive achievement and a sign of extraordinary self-discipline whereas weight gain is perceived as an unacceptable failure of self-control though some individuals with this disorder may acknowledge being thin they typically deny the serious medical implications of their malnourished state
in postmenarcheal females amenorrhea due to abnormally low levels of estrogen secretion that are due in turn to diminished pituitary secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone [fsh] and luteinizing hormone [lh] is an indicator of physiological dysfunction in anorexia nervosa criterion d amenorrhea is usually a consequence of the weight loss but in a minority of individuals may actually precede it in prepubertal females menarche may be delayed by the illness
the individual is often brought to professional attention by family members after marked weight loss or failure to make expected weight gains has occurred if individuals seek help on their own it is usually because of their subjective distress over the somatic and psychological sequelae of starvation it is rare for an individual with anorexia nervosa to complain of weight loss per se individuals with anorexia nervosa frequently lack insight into or have considerable denial of the problem and may be unreliable historians it is therefore often necessary to obtain information from parents or other outside sources to evaluate the degree of weight loss and other features of the illness


30751 bulimia nervosa

the essential features of bulimia nervosa are binge eating and inappropriate compen- satory methods to prevent weight gain in addition the self-evaluation of individuals with bulimia nervosa is excessively influenced by body shape and weight to qualify for the diagnosis the binge eating and the inappropriate compensatory behaviors must occur on average at least twice a week for 3 months criterionc
a binge is defined as eating in a discrete period of time an amount of food that is definitely larger than most individuals would eat under similar circumstances criterion al the clinician should consider the context in which the eating occurredâ€”what would be regarded as excessive consumption at a typical meal might be considered normal during a celebration or holiday meal a discrete period of time refers to a limited period usually less than 2 hours a single episode of binge eating need not be restricted to one setting for example an individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and then continue it on returning home continual snacking on small amounts of food throughout the day would not be considered a binge
although the type of food consumed during binges varies it typically includes sweet high-calorie foods such as ice cream or cake however binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the amount of food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient such as carbohydrate although individuals with bulimianervosa consume more calories during an episode of binge eating than persons without bulimia nervosa consume during a meal the fractions of calories derived from protein fat and carbohydrate are similar
individuals with bulimia nervosa are typically ashamed of their eating problems and attempt to conceal their symptoms binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as inconspicuously as possible an episode may or may not be planned in advance and is usually but not always characterized by rapid consumption the binge eating often continues until the individual is uncomfortably or even painfully full binge eating is typically triggered by dysphoric mood states interpersonal stressors intense hunger following dietary restraint or feelings related to body weight body shape and food binge eating may transiently reduce dysphoria but disparaging self-criticism and depressed mood often follow
an episode of binge eating is also accompanied by a sense of lack of control criterion a2 an individual may be in a frenzied state while binge eating especially early in the course of the disorder some individuals describe a dissociative quality during or following the binge episodes after bulimia nervosa has persisted for some time individuals may report that their binge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but rather by behavioral indicators of impaired control such as difficulty resisting binge eating or difficulty stopping a binge once it has begun the impairment in control associated with binge eating in bulimia nervosa is not absolute for example an individual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a roommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room
another essential feature of bulimia nervosa is the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain criterion b many individuals with bulimia nervosa employ several methods in their attempt to compensate for binge eating the most common compensatory technique is the induction of vomiting after an episode of binge eating this method of purging is employed by 80%-90% of individuals with bulimia nervosa who present for treatment at eating disorders clinics the immediate effects of vomiting include relief from physical discomfort and reduction of fear of gaining weight in some cases vomiting becomes a goal in itself and the person will binge in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of food individuals with bulimia nervosa may use a variety of methods to induce vomiting including the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the gag reflex individuals generally become adept at inducing vomiting and are eventually able to vomit at will rarely individuals consume syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting other purging behaviors include the misuse of laxatives and diuretics approximately one-third of those with bulimia nervosa misuse laxatives after binge eating rarely individuals with the disorder will misuse enemas following episodes of binge eating but this is seldom the sole compensatory method employed
individuals with bulimia nervosa may fast for a day or more or exercise excessively in an attempt to compensate for binge eating exercise may be considered to be excessive when it significantly interferes with important activities when it occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings or when the individual continues to exercise despite injury or other medical complications rarely individuals with this disorder may take thyroid hormone in an attempt to avoid weight gain individuals with diabetes mellitus and bulimia nervosa may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to reduce the metabolism of food consumed during eating binges
individuals with bulimia nervosa place an excessive emphasis on body shape and weight in their self-evaluation and these factors are typically the most important ones in determining self-esteem criterion d individuals with this disorder may closely resemble those with anorexia nervosa in their fear of gaining weight in their desire to lose weight and in the level of dissatisfaction with their bodies however a diagnosis
of bulimia nervosa should not be given when the disturbance occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa criterion e

30742 primary insomnia

the essential feature of primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or of nonrestorative sleep that lasts for at least 1 month criterion a and causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion b the disturbance in sleep does not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep disorder criterion c or mental disorder criterion d and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition criterione
individuals with primary insomnia most often report a combination of difficulty falling asleep and intermittent wakefulness during sleep less commonly these individuals may complain only of nonrestorative sleep that is feeling that their sleep was restless light or of poor quality primary insomnia is often associated with increased physiological or psychological arousal at nighttime in combination with negative conditioning for sleep a marked preoccupation with and distress due to the inability to sleep may contribute to the development of a vicious cycle the more the individual strives to sleep the more frustrated and distressed the individual becomes and the less he or she is able to sleep lying in a bed in which the individual has frequently spent sleepless nights may cause frustration and conditioned arousal conversely the individual may fall asleep more easily when not trying to do sowhile watching television reading or riding in a car some individuals with increased arousal and negative conditioning report that they sleep better away from their own bedrooms and their usual routines chronic insomnia may lead to decreased feelings of well-being during the daydeterioration of mood and motivation decreased attention energy and concentration and an increase in fatigue and malaise although individuals often have the subjective complaint of daytime fatigue polysomnographic studies usually do not demonstrate an increase in physiological signs of sleepiness

30744 primary hypersomnia

the essential feature of primary hypersomnia is excessive sleepiness for at least 1 month as evidenced either by prolonged sleep episodes or by daytime sleep episodes occurring almost daily criterion a the excessive sleepiness must be sufficiently severe to cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion b the excessive sleepiness does not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep disorder criterion c or mental disorder criterion d and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition criterion e in individuals with primary hypersomnia the duration of the major sleep episode for most individuals nocturnal sleep may range from 8 to 12 hours and is often followed by difficulty awakening in the morning the actual quality of nocturnal sleep is normal excessive sleepiness during normal waking hours takes the form of intentional naps or inadvertent episodes of sleep objective measurements demonstrate increased physiological sleepiness daytime naps tend to be relatively long often lasting an hour or more are experienced as unrefreshing and often do not lead to improved alertness individuals typically feel sleepiness developing over a period of time rather than experiencing a sudden sleep attack unintentional sleep episodes typically occur in low-stimulation and low-activity situationswhile attending lectures reading watching television or driving long distances
hypersomnia can lead to significant distress and dysfunction in work and social relationships prolonged nocturnal sleep and difficulty awakening can result in difficulty in meeting morning obligations unintentional daytime sleep episodes can be embarrassing and even dangerous if for instance the individual is driving or operating machinery when the episode occurs the low level of alertness that occurs while an individual fights sleepiness can lead to poor efficiency poor concentration and poor memory during daytime activities sleepiness often misattributed to boredom or laziness can also disrupt social and family relationships

347 narcolepsy

the essential features of narcolepsy are repeated irresistible attacks of refreshing sleep cataplexy and recurrent intrusions of elements of rapid eye movement rem sleep into the transition period between sleep and wakefulness the individual's sleepiness typically decreases after a sleep attack only to return several hours later the sleep attacks must occur daily over a period of at least 3 months to establish the diagnosis criterion a although most individuals describe many years of sleep attacks prior to seeking clinical attention in addition to sleepiness individuals with narcolepsy experience one or both of the following cataplexy ie episodes of sudden bilateral reversible loss of muscle tone that last for seconds to minutes and are usually precipitated by intense emotion criterion bl or recurrent intrusions of elements of rapid eye movement rem sleep into the transition between sleep and wakefulness as manifested by paralysis of voluntary muscles or dreamlike hallucinations criterion b2 many sleep experts allow the diagnosis to be made in the absence of cataplexy or intrusions ofrem sleep elements if the individual demonstrates pathological sleepiness and two or more sleep-onset remperiods during a multiple sleep latency test mslt the symptoms must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance including a medication or another general medical condition criterion c although narcolepsy is classified in the chapter of icd devoted to neurological conditions it is included in this section to assist in differential diagnosis in individuals with excessive sleepiness and is coded on axis i
episodes of sleepiness in narcolepsy are often described as irresistible resulting in unintended sleep in inappropriate situationswhile driving an automobile attending meetings or carrying on a conversation low-stimulation low-activity situations typically exaggerate the degree of sleepinessfalling asleep while reading watching television or attending lectures sleep episodes generally last 10-20 minutes but can last up to an hour if uninterrupted dreaming is frequently reported individuals have varying abilities to fight off these sleep attacks some individuals take naps intentionally in order to manage their sleepiness individuals with narcolepsy typically have 2-6 episodes of sleep intentional and unintentional per day when untreated sleep episodes are usually superimposed on a more normal degree of alertness although some individuals describe constant sleepiness of some degree
cataplexy often develops several years after the onset of daytime sleepiness and occurs in approximately 70% of individuals with the disorder the loss of muscle tone with cataplexy may be subtle leading to a sagging jaw or drooping eyelids head or arms not noticeable to observers cataplexy can also be more dramatic and the individual may drop objects being carried buckle at the knees or actually fall to the ground respiratory and eye muscles are not affected the muscle weakness usually lasts only seconds although periods of up to a half hour have been reported episodes are followed by a full return of normal muscle strength full consciousness and alertness are preserved during cataplectic episodes individuals can clearly describe events and have no confusion before or after the episode rarely prolonged episodes of cataplexy may lead into sleep episodes cataplexy is usually triggered by a strong emotional stimulusanger surprise laughter sleep deprivation typically increases the frequency and severity of episodes of cataplexy
approximately 20%-40% of individuals with narcolepsy also experience intense dreamlike imagery just before falling asleep hypnagogic hallucinations or just after awakening hypnopompic hallucinations most sleep-related hallucinations are visual and incorporate elements of the actual environment for instance individuals may describe objects appearing through cracks in the wall or describe objects moving in a picture on the wall the hallucinations may also be auditoryhearing intruders in the home or kineticsensation of flying approximately 30%-50% of individuals with narcolepsy also experience sleep paralysis just on falling asleep or awakening in this condition individuals describe being awake but unable to move or speak they may also complain of feeling unable to breathe although the diaphragm is spared and respiration continues sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis may occur simul-taneously resulting in an often terrifying experience of seeing or hearing unusual things and being unable to move both sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis last for seconds to a few minutes and terminate spontaneously both phenomena vivid mental imagery and skeletal muscle atonia are thought to result from dissociated elements of rem sleep intruding into wakefulness

78059 breathing-related sleep disorder

the essential feature of breathing-related sleep disorder is sleep disruption leading to excessive sleepiness or insomniathat is judged to be due to abnormalities of ventilation during sleepsleep apnea or central alveolar hypoventilation criterion a this sleep disruption must not be better accounted for by a mental disorder and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance including medication or a general medical condition that produces sleep symptoms through a mechanism other than abnormal breathing criterionb
excessive sleepiness is the most common presenting complaint of individuals with breathing-related sleep disorder sleepiness results from frequent arousals during nocturnal sleep as the individual attempts to breathe normally the sleepiness is most evident in relaxing situations such as when the individual is reading or watching television the individual's inability to control the sleepiness can be evident in boring meetings or while attending movies theater or concerts when sleepiness is extreme the person may fall asleep while actively conversing eating walking or driving naps tend to be unrefreshing and may be accompanied by a dull headache on awakening however there can be considerable variation in the intensity of the sleepiness the impact of the sleepiness may be minimized by the individual who may express pride about being able to sleep anywhere at anytime insomnia frequent awakenings or unrefreshing sleep are less frequent than daytime sleepiness as the presenting complaint in individuals with breathing-related sleep disorder some individuals may complain of difficulty breathing while lying supine or sleeping
abnormal respiratory events during sleep in breathing-related sleep disorder include apneas episodes of breathing cessation hypopneas abnormally slow or shallow respiration and hypoventilation abnormal blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels three forms of breathing-related sleep disorder have been described obstructive sleep apnea syndrome central sleep apnea syndrome and central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome
obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is the most common form of breathing-related sleep disorder it is characterized by repeated episodes of upper-airway obstruction apneas and hypopneas during sleep the central drive for respiration and respiratory movements in the chest and abdomen are preserved it usually occurs in overweight individuals and leads to a complaint of excessive sleepiness obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by loud snores or brief gasps that alternate with episodes of silence that usually last 20-30 seconds snoring is caused by breathing through a partially obstructed airway silent periods are caused by obstructive apneas with the cessation in breathing caused by complete airway obstruction typically the loud snoring has been present for many years often since childhood but an increase in its severity may lead the individual to seek evaluation the snoring is commonly loud enough to disturb the sleep of others in close proximity the cessation of breathing sometimes lasting as long as 60-90 seconds and associated with cyanosis may also be of concern to bed partners the termination of the apneic event can be associated with loud resuscitative snores gasps moans or mumbling or whole-body movements the bed partner may have to move to a separate bed or another room as a result of the affected individual's snoring gasps and movements most affected individuals are unaware of the loud snoring breathing difficulty and frequent arousals however some persons particularly elderly persons are intensely aware of the sleep disturbance and present with a complaint of frequent awakenings and unrefreshing sleep
central sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by episodic cessation of ventilation during sleep apneas and hypopneas without airway obstruction thus in contrast to obstructive apnea events central apneas are not associated with continued chest wall and abdominal breathing movements and occur more commonly in elderly persons as a result of cardiac or neurological conditions that affect ventilatory regulation individuals most often present with complaints of insomnia due to repeated awakenings which they may or may not associate with breathing difficulties individuals with central sleep apnea may have mild snoring but it is not a prominent complaint
the central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome is characterized by an impairment in ventilatory control that results in abnormally low arterial oxygen levels further worsened by sleep hypoventilation without apneas or hypopneas the lungs in individuals with this disorder have normal mechanical properties this form most commonly occurs in very overweight individuals and can be associated with a complaint of either excessive sleepiness or insomnia

30745 circadian rhythm sleep disorder formerly sleep-wake schedule disorder

the essential feature of circadian rhythm sleep disorder is a persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that results from a mismatch between the individual's endogenous circadian sleep-wake system on the one hand and exogenous demands regarding the timing and duration of sleep on the other criterion a in contrast to other primary sleep disorders circadian rhythm sleep disorder does not result from the mechanisms generating sleep and wakefulness per se as a result of this circadian mismatch individuals with this disorder may complain of insomnia at certain times during the day and excessive sleepiness at other times with resulting impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning or marked subjective distress criterion b the sleep problems are not better accounted for by other sleep disorders or other mental disorders criterion c and are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition criterion d
the diagnosis of circadian rhythm sleep disorder should be reserved for those presentations in which the individual has significant social or occupational impairment or marked distress related to the sleep disturbance individuals vary widely in their ability to adapt to circadian changes and requirements many if not most individuals with circadian-related symptoms of sleep disturbance do not seek treatment and do not have symptoms of sufficient severity to warrant a diagnosis those who present for evaluation because of this disorder are most often troubled by the severity or persistence of their symptoms for example it is not unusual for shift workers to present for evaluation after falling asleep while on the job or while driving
the diagnosis of circadian rhythm sleep disorder rests primarily on the clinical history including the pattern of work sleep naps and free time the history should also examine past attempts at coping with symptoms such as attempts at advancing the sleep-wake schedule in delayed sleep phase type prospective sleep-wake diaries or sleep charts are often a useful adjunct to diagnosis

30747 nightmare disorder
formerly dream anxiety disorder 
the essential feature of nightmare disorder is the repeated occurrence of frightening dreams that lead to awakenings from sleep criterion a the individual becomes fully alert on awakening criterion b the frightening dreams or sleep interruptions resulting from the awakenings cause the individual significant distress or result in social or occupational dysfunction criterion c this disorder is not diagnosed if the nightmares occur exclusively during the course of another mental disorder or are due to the direct physiological effects of a substancea drug of abuse or a medication or a general medical condition criterion d
nightmares typically occur in a lengthy elaborate dream sequence that is highly anxiety provoking or terrifying dream content most often focuses on imminent physical danger to the individualpursuit attack injury in other cases the perceived danger may be more subtle involving personal failure or embarrassment nightmares that occur after traumatic experiences may replicate the original dangerous or threatening situation but most nightmares do not recount actual events on awakening individuals with this disorder can describe the dream sequence and content in detail individuals may report multiple nightmares within a given night often with a recurrent theme nightmares arise almost exclusively during rapid eye movement remsleep because rem episodes occur periodically throughout nocturnal sleep approximately every 90-110 minutes nightmares may also occur at any time during the sleep episode however because rem sleep periods typically become longer and dreaming more intense in the second half of the night nightmares are also more likely to occur later in the night
nightmares usually terminate with an awakening that is associated with a rapid return of full alertness and a lingering sense of fear or anxiety these factors often lead to difficulty returning to sleep nightmare disorder causes significant subjective distress more often than it causes demonstrable social or occupational impairment however if nocturnal awakenings are frequent or if the individual avoids sleeping because of fear of nightmares the individual may experience excessive sleepiness poor concentration depression anxiety or irritability that can disrupt daytime functioning

30746 sleep terror disorder

the essential feature of sleep terror disorder is the repeated occurrence of sleep terrors that is abrupt awakenings from sleep usually beginning with a panicky scream or cry criterion a sleep terrors usually begin during the first third of the major sleep episode and last 1-10 minutes the episodes are accompanied by autonomic arousal and behavioral manifestations of intense fear criterion b during an episode the individual is difficult to awaken or comfort criterion c if the individual awakens after the sleep terror no dream is recalled or only fragmentary single images are recalled on awakening the following morning the individual has amnesia for the event criterion d the sleep terror episodes must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion e sleep terror disorder should not be diagnosed if the recurrent events are due to the direct physiological effects of a substancea drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition criterion f sleep terrors are also called night terrors or pavor nocturnus
during a typical episode the individual abruptly sits up in bed screaming or crying with a frightened expression and autonomic signs of intense anxietytachycardia rapid breathing flushing of the skin sweating dilation of the pupils increased muscle tone the individual is usually unresponsive to the efforts of others to awaken or comfort him or her if awakened the person is confused and disoriented for several minutes and recounts a vague sense of terror usually without dream content although fragmentary vivid dream images may occur a story-like dream sequence as in nightmares is not reported most commonly the individual does not awaken fully but returns to sleep and has amnesia for the episode on awakening the next morning some individuals may vaguely recall having an episode during the previous night but do not have detailed recall usually only one episode will occur on any one night although occasionally several episodes may occur at intervals throughout the night
for the diagnosis to be made the individual must experience clinically significant distress or impairment embarrassment concerning the episodes can impair social relationships individuals may avoid situations in which others might become aware of the disturbance such as going to camp visiting friends overnight or sleeping with bed partners

30746 sleepwalking disorder

the essential feature of sleepwalking disorder is repeated episodes of complex motor behavior initiated during sleep including rising from bed and walking about sleepwalk- ing episodes begin during slow-wave sleep and therefore most often occur during the first third of the night criterion a during episodes the individual has reduced alertness and responsiveness a blank stare and relative unresponsiveness to communication with others or efforts to be awakened by others criterion b if awakened during the episode or on awakening the following morning the individual has limited recall for the events of the episode criterion c after the episode there may initially be a brief period of confusion or difficulty orienting followed by full recovery of cognitive function and appropriate behavior criterion d the sleepwalking must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning criterion e sleepwalking disorder should not be diagnosed if the behavior is due to the direct physiological effects of a substancea drug of abuse a medication or a general medical condition criterionf
sleepwalking episodes can include a variety of behaviors in mild episodes sometimes called confusional arousals the individual may simply sit up in bed look about or pick at the blanket or sheet more typically the individual actually gets out of bed and may walk into closets out of the room up and down stairs and even out of buildings individuals may use the bathroom eat and talk during episodes running and frantic attempts to escape some apparent threat can also occur most behaviors during sleepwalking episodes are routine and of low complexity however cases of unlocking doors and even operating machinery have been reported particularly in childhood sleepwalking can also include inappropriate behaviorurinating in a closet most episodes last for several minutes to a half hour
sleepwalking episodes can terminate in spontaneous arousals followed by a brief period of confusion or the individual may return to bed and continue to sleep until the morning not uncommonly the individual may awaken the next morning in another place or with evidence of having performed some activity during the night but with complete amnesia for the event some episodes may be followed by vague recall of fragmentary dream images but usually not by typical story-like dreams
during sleepwalking episodes individuals may talk or even respond to others' questions however their articulation is poor and true dialogue is rare individuals may respond to others' requests to cease their activity and return to bed however these behaviors are performed with reduced levels of alertness and awakening an individual from a sleepwalking episode is typically very difficult if awakened the individual remains confused for several minutes and then returns to a normal state of alertness
for the diagnosis to be made the individual must experience clinically significant distress or impairment individuals may avoid situations that would reveal their behavior to otherschildren may avoid visiting friends or going to summer camp adults may avoid sleeping with bed partners going on vacation or staying away from home social isolation or occupational difficulties can result
